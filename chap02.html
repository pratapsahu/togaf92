<p>For the purposes of the TOGAF standard, the core concepts provided in this chapter apply.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_02_01"></a>2.1 What is the TOGAF Standard?</h3>

<p>The TOGAF standard is an architecture framework. It provides the methods and tools for assisting in the acceptance, production,
use, and maintenance of an Enterprise Architecture. It is based on an iterative process model supported by best practices and a
re-usable set of existing architecture assets.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_02_02"></a>2.2 What is Architecture in the Context of the TOGAF Standard?</h3>

<p>ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011 defines "architecture" as:</p>

<blockquote>"The fundamental concepts or properties of a system in its environment embodied in its elements, relationships, and in
the principles of its design and evolution."</blockquote>

<p>The TOGAF standard embraces but does not strictly adhere to ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011 terminology. In addition to the ISO/IEC/IEEE
42010:2011 definition of "architecture", the TOGAF standard defines a second meaning depending upon the context:</p>

<blockquote>"The structure of components, their inter-relationships, and the principles and guidelines governing their design and
evolution over time."</blockquote>

<p>The TOGAF standard considers the enterprise as a system and endeavors to strike a balance between promoting the concepts and
terminology drawn from relevant standards, and commonly accepted terminology that is familiar to the majority of the TOGAF
readership. For more on terminology, refer to <a href="chap03.html#tag_03"><i>3. Definitions</i></a> and <a href="pt4.html">Part
IV</a>, <a href="chap31.html#tag_31"><i>31. Architectural Artifacts</i></a> .</p>

<h3><a name="tag_02_03"></a>2.3 What Kind of Architecture Does the TOGAF Standard Deal With?</h3>

<p>There are four architecture domains that are commonly accepted as subsets of an overall Enterprise Architecture, all of which
the TOGAF standard is designed to support:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <b>Business Architecture</b> defines the business strategy, governance, organization, and key business processes</li>

<li>The <b>Data Architecture</b> describes the structure of an organization's logical and physical data assets and data management
resources</li>

<li>The <b>Application Architecture</b> provides a blueprint for the individual applications to be deployed, their interactions,
and their relationships to the core business processes of the organization</li>

<li>The <b>Technology Architecture</b> describes the logical software and hardware capabilities that are required to support the
deployment of business, data, and application services; this includes IT infrastructure, middleware, networks, communications,
processing, standards, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="tag_02_04"></a>2.4 Architecture Development Method</h3>

<p>The TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM) provides a tested and repeatable process for developing architectures. The ADM
includes establishing an architecture framework, developing architecture content, transitioning, and governing the realization of
architectures.</p>

<p>All of these activities are carried out within an iterative cycle of continuous architecture definition and realization that
allows organizations to transform their enterprises in a controlled manner in response to business goals and opportunities.</p>

<p>Phases within the ADM are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <b>Preliminary Phase</b> describes the preparation and initiation activities required to create an Architecture Capability
including customization of the TOGAF framework and definition of Architecture Principles</li>

<li><b>Phase&nbsp;A: Architecture Vision</b> describes the initial phase of an architecture development cycle 

<p>It includes information about defining the scope of the architecture development initiative, identifying the stakeholders,
creating the Architecture Vision, and obtaining approval to proceed with the architecture development.</p>
</li>

<li><b>Phase&nbsp;B: Business Architecture</b> describes the development of a Business Architecture to support the agreed
Architecture Vision</li>

<li><b>Phase&nbsp;C: Information Systems Architectures</b> describes the development of Information Systems Architectures to
support the agreed Architecture Vision</li>

<li><b>Phase&nbsp;D: Technology Architecture</b> describes the development of the Technology Architecture to support the agreed
Architecture Vision</li>

<li><b>Phase&nbsp;E: Opportunities &amp; Solutions</b> conducts initial implementation planning and the identification of delivery
vehicles for the architecture defined in the previous phases</li>

<li><b>Phase&nbsp;F: Migration Planning</b> addresses how to move from the Baseline to the Target Architectures by finalizing a
detailed Implementation and Migration Plan</li>

<li><b>Phase&nbsp;G: Implementation Governance</b> provides an architectural oversight of the implementation</li>

<li><b>Phase&nbsp;H: Architecture Change Management</b> establishes procedures for managing change to the new architecture</li>

<li><b>Requirements Management</b> examines the process of managing architecture requirements throughout the ADM</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="tag_02_05"></a>2.5 Deliverables, Artifacts, and Building Blocks</h3>

<p>Architects executing the ADM will produce a number of outputs as a result of their efforts, such as process flows, architectural
requirements, project plans, project compliance assessments, etc. The TOGAF Architecture Content Framework (see <a href=
"pt4.html">Part IV</a>, <a href="chap29.html#tag_29"><i>29. Introduction to Part IV</i></a>) provides a structural model for
architectural content that allows major work products to be consistently defined, structured, and presented.</p>

<p>The Architecture Content Framework uses the following three categories to describe the type of architectural work product within
the context of use:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <b>deliverable</b> is a work product that is contractually specified and in turn formally reviewed, agreed, and signed off by
the stakeholders 

<p>Deliverables represent the output of projects and those deliverables that are in documentation form will typically be archived
at completion of a project, or transitioned into an Architecture Repository as a reference model, standard, or snapshot of the
Architecture Landscape at a point in time.</p>
</li>

<li>An <b>artifact</b> is an architectural work product that describes an aspect of the architecture 

<p>Artifacts are generally classified as catalogs (lists of things), matrices (showing relationships between things), and diagrams
(pictures of things). Examples include a requirements catalog, business interaction matrix, and a use-case diagram. An
architectural deliverable may contain many artifacts and artifacts will form the content of the Architecture Repository.</p>
</li>

<li>A <b>building block</b> represents a (potentially re-usable) component of enterprise capability that can be combined with other
building blocks to deliver architectures and solutions 

<p>Building blocks can be defined at various levels of detail, depending on what stage of architecture development has been
reached. For instance, at an early stage, a building block can simply consist of a name or an outline description. Later on, a
building block may be decomposed into multiple supporting building blocks and may be accompanied by a full specification. Building
blocks can relate to "architectures" or "solutions".</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs)</b> typically describe required capability and shape the specification of Solution
Building Blocks (SBBs); for example, a customer services capability may be required within an enterprise, supported by many SBBs,
such as processes, data, and application software</li>

<li><b>Solution Building Blocks (SBBs)</b> represent components that will be used to implement the required capability; for
example, a network is a building block that can be described through complementary artifacts and then put to use to realize
solutions for the enterprise</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The relationships between deliverables, artifacts, and building blocks are shown in <a href="#tagfcjh_2">Figure 2-1</a> .</p>

<br>
 

<center><small><i><a name="tagfcjh_2"></a> Figure 2-1: Relationships between Deliverables, Artifacts, and Building
Blocks</i></small></center>

<p>For example, an Architecture Definition Document is a deliverable that documents an Architecture Description. This document will
contain a number of complementary artifacts that are views of the building blocks relevant to the architecture. For example, a
process flow diagram (an artifact) may be created to describe the target call handling process (a building block). This artifact
may also describe other building blocks, such as the actors involved in the process (e.g., a Customer Services Representative). An
example of the relationships between deliverables, artifacts, and building blocks is illustrated in <a href="#tagfcjh_3">Figure
2-2</a> .</p>

<h3><a name="tag_02_06"></a>2.6 Enterprise Continuum</h3>

<p>The TOGAF standard includes the concept of the Enterprise Continuum, which sets the broader context for an architect and
explains how generic solutions can be leveraged and specialized in order to support the requirements of an individual organization.
The Enterprise Continuum is a view of the Architecture Repository that provides methods for classifying architecture and solution
artifacts as they evolve from generic Foundation Architectures to Organization-Specific Architectures. The Enterprise Continuum
comprises two complementary concepts: the Architecture Continuum and the Solutions Continuum.</p>

<p>An overview of the structure and context for the Enterprise Continuum is shown in <a href="#tagfcjh_4">Figure 2-3</a> .</p>

<center><a href="Figures/39_entcon_oview.png" target="new"><img src="Figures/39_entcon_oview.png" border="0" width="90%">

<hr>
<h3><a name="tag_02_07"></a>2.7 Architecture Repository</h3>

<p>Supporting the Enterprise Continuum is the concept of an Architecture Repository which can be used to store different classes of
architectural output at different levels of abstraction, created by the ADM. In this way, the TOGAF standard facilitates
understanding and co-operation between stakeholders and practitioners at different levels.</p>

<p>By means of the Enterprise Continuum and Architecture Repository, architects are encouraged to leverage all other relevant
architectural resources and assets in developing an Organization-Specific Architecture.</p>

<p>In this context, the TOGAF ADM can be regarded as describing a process lifecycle that operates at multiple levels within the
organization, operating within a holistic governance framework and producing aligned outputs that reside in an Architecture
Repository. The Enterprise Continuum provides a valuable context for understanding architectural models: it shows building blocks
and their relationships to each other, and the constraints and requirements on a cycle of architecture development.</p>

<p>The structure of the TOGAF Architecture Repository is shown in <a href="#tagfcjh_5">Figure 2-4</a> .</p>

<center><a href="Figures/02_concepts3.png" target="new"><img src="Figures/02_concepts3.png" border="0" width="80%"></a></center>

<br>
<br>
 

<center><small><i><a name="tagfcjh_5"></a> Figure 2-4: TOGAF Architecture Repository Structure</i></small></center>

<br>
 

<p>The major components within an Architecture Repository are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <b>Architecture Metamodel</b> describes the organizationally tailored application of an architecture framework, including a
metamodel for architecture content</li>

<li>The <b>Architecture Capability</b> defines the parameters, structures, and processes that support governance of the
Architecture Repository</li>

<li>The <b>Architecture Landscape</b> is the architectural representation of assets deployed within the operating enterprise at a
particular point in time - the landscape is likely to exist at multiple levels of abstraction to suit different architecture
objectives</li>

<li>The <b>Standards Information Base</b> (SIB) captures the standards with which new architectures must comply, which may include
industry standards, selected products and services from suppliers, or shared services already deployed within the organization</li>

<li>The <b>Reference Library</b> provides guidelines, templates, patterns, and other forms of reference material that can be
leveraged in order to accelerate the creation of new architectures for the enterprise</li>

<li>The <b>Governance Log</b> provides a record of governance activity across the enterprise</li>

<li>The <b>Architecture Requirements Repository</b> provides a view of all authorized architecture requirements which have been
agreed with the Architecture Board</li>

<li>The <b>Solutions Landscape</b> presents an architectural representation of the SBBs supporting the Architecture Landscape which
have been planned or deployed by the enterprise</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="tag_02_08"></a>2.8 Establishing and Maintaining an Enterprise Architecture Capability</h3>

<p>In order to carry out architectural activity effectively within an enterprise, it is necessary to put in place an appropriate
business capability for architecture, through organization structures, roles, responsibilities, skills, and processes. An overview
of the TOGAF Architecture Capability is shown in <a href="#tagfcjh_6">Figure 2-5</a> .</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="tag_02_09"></a>2.9 Establishing the Architecture Capability as an Operational Entity</h3>

<p>Barring Architecture Capabilities set up to purely support change delivery programs, it is increasingly recognized that a
successful Enterprise Architecture practice must sit on a firm operational footing. In effect, an Enterprise Architecture practice
must be run like any other operational unit within a business; i.e., it should be treated like a business. To this end, and over
and above the core processes defined within the ADM, an Enterprise Architecture practice should establish capabilities in the
following areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Financial Management</li>

<li>Performance Management</li>

<li>Service Management</li>

<li>Risk Management (see <a href="apdxa.html#tag_47_54"><i>A.54 Risk Management</i></a>)</li>

<li>Resource Management</li>

<li>Communications and Stakeholder Management (see <a href="chap03.html#tag_03_33"><i>3.33 Communications and Stakeholder
Management</i></a>)</li>

<li>Quality Management</li>

<li>Supplier Management (see <a href="apdxa.html#tag_47_60"><i>A.60 Supplier Management</i></a>)</li>

<li>Configuration Management (see <a href="apdxa.html#tag_47_07"><i>A.7 Configuration Management</i></a>)</li>

<li>Environment Management</li>
</ul>

<p>Central to the notion of operating an ongoing architecture is the execution of well-defined and effective governance, whereby
all architecturally significant activity is controlled and aligned within a single framework.</p>

<p>As governance has become an increasingly visible requirement for organizational management, the inclusion of governance within
the TOGAF standard aligns the framework with current business best practice and also ensures a level of visibility, guidance, and
control that will support all architecture stakeholder requirements and obligations.</p>

<p>The benefits of Architecture Governance include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Increased transparency of accountability, and informed delegation of authority</li>

<li>Controlled risk management</li>

<li>Protection of the existing asset base through maximizing re-use of existing architectural components</li>

<li>Proactive control, monitoring, and management mechanisms</li>

<li>Process, concept, and component re-use across all organizational business units</li>

<li>Value creation through monitoring, measuring, evaluation, and feedback</li>

<li>Increased visibility supporting internal processes and external parties' requirements; in particular, increased visibility of
decision-making at lower levels ensures oversight at an appropriate level within the enterprise of decisions that may have
far-reaching strategic consequences for the organization</li>

<li>Greater shareholder value; in particular, Enterprise Architecture increasingly represents the core intellectual property of the
enterprise - studies have demonstrated a correlation between increased shareholder value and well-governed enterprises</li>

<li>Integrates with existing processes and methodologies and complements functionality by adding control capabilities</li>
</ul>

<p>Further detail on establishing an Enterprise Architecture Capability is given in <a href="pt5.html">Part VI</a>, <a href=
"chap39.html#tag_39"><i>39. Introduction to Part VI</i></a> .</p>

<h3><a name="tag_02_10"></a>2.10 Using the TOGAF Standard with Other Frameworks</h3>

<p>Two of the key elements of any Enterprise Architecture framework are:</p>

<ul>
<li>A definition of the deliverables that the architecting activity should produce</li>

<li>A description of the method by which this should be done</li>
</ul>

<p>With some exceptions, the majority of Enterprise Architecture frameworks focus on the first of these - the specific set of
deliverables - and are relatively silent about the methods to be used to generate them (intentionally so, in some cases).</p>

<p>Because the TOGAF standard is a generic framework and intended to be used in a wide variety of environments, it provides a
flexible and extensible content framework that underpins a set of generic architecture deliverables.</p>

<p>As a result, the TOGAF framework may be used either in its own right, with the generic deliverables that it describes; or else
these deliverables may be replaced or extended by a more specific set, defined in any other framework that the architect considers
relevant.</p>

<p>In all cases, it is expected that the architect will adapt and build on the TOGAF framework in order to define a tailored method
that is integrated into the processes and organization structures of the enterprise. This architecture tailoring may include
adopting elements from other architecture frameworks, or integrating TOGAF methods with other standard frameworks or best
practices, such as ITIL&reg;, CMMI&reg;, COBIT&reg;, PRINCE2&reg;, PMBOK&reg;, and MSP&reg;. It may also include adopting reference
materials from the TOGAF Library, such as the IT4IT<sup>&trade;</sup> Reference Architecture. Guidelines for adapting the TOGAF
ADM in such a way are given in <a href="pt2.html">Part II</a>, <a href="chap04.html#tag_04_03"><i>4.3 Adapting the ADM</i></a>
.</p>

<p>As a generic framework and method for Enterprise Architecture, the TOGAF standard provides the capability and the collaborative
environment to integrate with other frameworks. Organizations are able to fully utilize vertical business domains, horizontal
technology areas (such as security or manageability), or application areas (such as e-Commerce) to produce a competitive Enterprise
Architecture framework which maximizes their business opportunities. <!--page footer start-->
