<h3><a name="tag_03_01"></a>3.1 Abstraction</h3>

<p>The technique of providing summarized or generalized descriptions of detailed and complex content. <basefont size="2"></p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Note:</b></dt>

<dd>Abstraction, as in "level of abstraction", can also mean providing a focus for analysis that is concerned with a consistent and
common level of detail or abstraction. Abstraction in this sense is typically used in architecture to allow a consistent level of
definition and understanding to be achieved in each area of the architecture in order to support effective communication and
decision-making. It is especially useful when dealing with large and complex architectures as it allows relevant issues to be
identified before further detail is attempted.</dd>
</dl>

<basefont size="3"> 

<h3><a name="tag_03_02"></a>3.2 Actor</h3>

<p>A person, organization, or system that has one or more roles that initiates or interacts with activities; for example, a sales
representative who travels to visit customers. Actors may be internal or external to an organization. <basefont size="2"></p>

reached. For instance, at an early stage, a building block can simply consist of a name or an outline description. Later on, a
building block may be decomposed into multiple supporting building blocks and may be accompanied by a full specification. Building
blocks can relate to "architectures" or "solutions".

standards to a non-specialist. A reference model is not directly tied to any standards, technologies, or other concrete
implementation details, but it does seek to provide common semantics that can be used unambiguously across and between different
implementations.
