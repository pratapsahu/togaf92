</ul>

<h3><a name="tag_09_03"></a>9.3 Steps</h3>

<p>The level of detail addressed in Phase C will depend on the scope and goals of the overall architecture effort.</p>

<p>New data building blocks being introduced as part of this effort will need to be defined in detail during Phase C. Existing data
building blocks to be carried over and supported in the target environment may already have been adequately defined in previous
architectural work; but, if not, they too will need to be defined in Phase C.</p>

<p>The order of the steps in this phase as well as the time at which they are formally started and completed should be adapted to
the situation at hand in accordance with the established Architecture Governance. In particular, determine whether in this
situation it is appropriate to conduct Baseline Description or Target Architecture development first, as described in <a href=
"pt3.html">Part III</a>, <a href="chap18.html#tag_18"><i>18. Applying Iteration to the ADM</i></a> .</p>

<p>All activities that have been initiated in these steps should be closed during the Finalize the Data Architecture step (see <a
href="#tag_09_03_08">9.3.8 Finalize the Data Architecture</a>). The documentation generated from these steps must be formally
published in the Create the Architecture Definition Document step (see <a href="#tag_09_03_09">9.3.9 Create the Architecture
Definition Document</a>).</p>

<p>The steps in Phase C (Data Architecture) are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#tag_09_03_01">9.3.1 Select Reference Models, Viewpoints, and
Tools</a></li>

<li><a href="#tag_09_03_02">9.3.2 Develop Baseline Data Architecture
Description</a></li>

<li><a href="#tag_09_03_03">9.3.3 Develop Target Data Architecture
Description</a></li>

<li><a href="#tag_09_03_04">9.3.4 Perform Gap Analysis</a></li>

<li><a href="#tag_09_03_05">9.3.5 Define Candidate Roadmap Components</a></li>

<li><a href="#tag_09_03_06">9.3.6 Resolve Impacts Across the Architecture
Landscape</a></li>

<li><a href="#tag_09_03_07">9.3.7 Conduct Formal Stakeholder Review</a></li>

<li><a href="#tag_09_03_08">9.3.8 Finalize the Data Architecture</a></li>

<li><a href="#tag_09_03_09">9.3.9 Create the Architecture Definition Document</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="tag_09_03_01"></a>9.3.1 Select Reference Models, Viewpoints, and Tools</h4>

<p>Review and validate (or generate, if necessary) the set of data principles. These will normally form part of an overarching set
of Architecture Principles. Guidelines for developing and applying principles, and a sample set of data principles, are given in <a
href="pt3.html">Part III</a>, <a href="chap20.html#tag_20"><i>20. Architecture Principles</i></a> .</p>

<p>Select relevant Data Architecture resources (reference models, patterns, etc.) on the basis of the business drivers,
stakeholders, concerns, and Business Architecture.</p>

<p>Select relevant Data Architecture viewpoints (for example, stakeholders of the data - regulatory bodies, users, generators,
subjects, auditors, etc.; various time dimensions - real-time, reporting period, event-driven, etc.; locations; business
processes); i.e., those that will enable the architect to demonstrate how the stakeholder concerns are being addressed in the Data
Architecture.</p>

<p>Identify appropriate tools and techniques (including forms) to be used for data capture, modeling, and analysis, in association
with the selected viewpoints. Depending on the degree of sophistication warranted, these may comprise simple documents or
spreadsheets, or more sophisticated modeling tools and techniques such as data management models, data models, etc.<br>
</p>

<p>Examples of data modeling techniques are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Entity-relationship diagram</li>

<li>Class diagram</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="header4"><a name="tag_09_03_01_01"></a>9.3.1.1 Determine Overall Modeling Process</h5>

<p>For each viewpoint, select the models needed to support the specific view required, using the selected tool or method.</p>

<p>Ensure that all stakeholder concerns are covered. If they are not, create new models to address concerns not covered, or augment
existing models (see above).</p>

<p>The recommended process for developing a Data Architecture is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Collect data-related models from existing Business Architecture and Application Architecture materials</li>

<li>Rationalize data requirements and align with any existing enterprise data catalogs and models; this allows the development of a
data inventory and entity relationship</li>

<li>Update and develop matrices across the architecture by relating data to business service, business function, access rights, and
application</li>

<li>Elaborate Data Architecture views by examining how data is created, distributed, migrated, secured, and archived</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="header4"><a name="tag_09_03_01_02"></a>9.3.1.2 Identify Required Catalogs of Data Building Blocks</h5>

<p>The organization's data inventory is captured as a catalog within the Architecture Repository. Catalogs are hierarchical in
nature and capture a decomposition of a metamodel entity and also decompositions across related model entities (e.g., logical data
component -&gt; physical data component -&gt; data entity).</p>

<p>Catalogs form the raw material for development of matrices and diagrams and also act as a key resource for managing the business
and IT capability.</p>

<p>During the Business Architecture phase, a Business Service/Information diagram was created showing the key data entities
required by the main business services. This is a prerequisite to successful Data Architecture activities.</p>

<p>Using the traceability from application to business function to data entity inherent in the content framework, it is possible to
create an inventory of the data needed to be in place to support the Architecture Vision.</p>

<p>Once the data requirements are consolidated in a single location, it is possible to refine the data inventory to achieve
semantic consistency and to remove gaps and overlaps.</p>

<p>The following catalogs should be considered for development within a Data Architecture:</p>

<ul>
<li>Data Entity/Data Component catalog</li>
</ul>

<p>The structure of catalogs is based on the attributes of metamodel entities, as defined in <a href="pt4.html">Part IV</a>, <a
href="chap30.html#tag_30"><i>30. Content Metamodel</i></a> .</p>

<h5 class="header4"><a name="tag_09_03_01_03"></a>9.3.1.3 Identify Required Matrices</h5>

<p>Matrices show the core relationships between related model entities.</p>

<p>Matrices form the raw material for development of diagrams and also act as a key resource for impact assessment.</p>

<p>At this stage, an entity to applications matrix could be produced to validate this mapping. How data is created, maintained,
transformed, and passed to other applications, or used by other applications, will now start to be understood. Obvious gaps such as
entities that never seem to be created by an application or data created but never used, need to be noted for later gap
analysis.</p>

<p>The rationalized data inventory can be used to update and refine the architectural diagrams of how data relates to other aspects
of the architecture.</p>

<p>Once these updates have been made, it may be appropriate to drop into a short iteration of the Application Architecture to
resolve the changes identified.</p>

<p>The following matrices should be considered for development within a Data Architecture:</p>

<ul>
<li>Data Entity/Business Function (showing which data supports which functions and which business function owns which data)</li>

<li>Business Service/Information (developed during the Business Architecture phase)</li>

<li>Application/Data (developed across the Application Architecture and Data Architecture phases)</li>
</ul>

<p>The structure of matrices is based on the attributes of metamodel entities, as defined in <a href="pt4.html">Part IV</a>, <a
href="chap30.html#tag_30"><i>30. Content Metamodel</i></a> .</p>

<h5 class="header4"><a name="tag_09_03_01_04"></a>9.3.1.4 Identify Required Diagrams</h5>

<p>Diagrams present the Data Architecture information from a set of different perspectives (viewpoints) according to the
requirements of the stakeholders.</p>

<p>Once the data entities have been refined, a diagram of the relationships between entities and their attributes can be
produced.</p>

<p>It is important to note at this stage that information may be a mixture of enterprise-level data (from system service providers
and package vendor information) and local-level data held in personal databases and spreadsheets.</p>

<p>The level of detail modeled needs to be carefully assessed. Some physical system data models will exist down to a very detailed
level; others will only have core entities modeled. Not all data models will have been kept up-to-date as applications were
modified and extended over time. It is important to achieve a balance in the level of detail provided (e.g., reproducing existing
detailed system physical data schemas or presenting high-level process maps and data requirements, highlight the two extreme
views).</p>

<p>The following diagrams should be considered for development within a Data Architecture:</p>

<ul>
<li>Conceptual Data diagram</li>

<li>Logical Data diagram</li>

<li>Data Dissemination diagram</li>

<li>Data Lifecycle diagram</li>

<li>Data Security diagram</li>

<li>Data Migration diagram</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="header4"><a name="tag_09_03_01_05"></a>9.3.1.5 Identify Types of Requirement to be Collected</h5>

<p>Once the Data Architecture catalogs, matrices, and diagrams have been developed, architecture modeling is completed by
formalizing the data-focused requirements for implementing the Target Architecture.</p>

<p>These requirements may:</p>

<ul>
<li>Relate to the data domain</li>

<li>Provide requirements input into the Application and Technology Architectures</li>

<li>Provide detailed guidance to be reflected during design and implementation to ensure that the solution addresses the original
architecture requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>Within this step, the architect should identify requirements that should be met by the architecture (see <a href=
"chap16.html#tag_16_05_02"><i>16.5.2 Requirements Development</i></a>).</p>

<h4><a name="tag_09_03_02"></a>9.3.2 Develop Baseline Data Architecture Description</h4>

<p>Develop a Baseline Description of the existing Data Architecture, to the extent necessary to support the Target Data
Architecture. The scope and level of detail to be defined will depend on the extent to which existing data elements are likely to
be carried over into the Target Data Architecture, and on whether architectural descriptions exist, as described in <a href=
"#tag_09_05">9.5 Approach</a> . To the extent possible, identify the relevant Data Architecture building blocks, drawing on the
Architecture Repository (see <a href="pt5.html">Part V</a>, <a href="chap37.html#tag_37"><i>37. Architecture Repository</i></a>
).</p>

<p>Where new architecture models need to be developed to satisfy stakeholder concerns, use the models identified within Step 1 as a
guideline for creating new architecture content to describe the Baseline Architecture.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_09_03_03"></a>9.3.3 Develop Target Data Architecture Description</h4>

<p>Develop a Target Description for the Data Architecture, to the extent necessary to support the Architecture Vision and Target
Business Architecture. The scope and level of detail to be defined will depend on the relevance of the data elements to attaining
the Target Architecture, and on whether architectural descriptions exist. To the extent possible, identify the relevant Data
Architecture building blocks, drawing on the Architecture Repository (see <a href="pt5.html">Part V</a>, <a href=
"chap37.html#tag_37"><i>37. Architecture Repository</i></a>).</p>

<p>Where new architecture models need to be developed to satisfy stakeholder concerns, use the models identified within Step 1 as a
guideline for creating new architecture content to describe the Target Architecture.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_09_03_04"></a>9.3.4 Perform Gap Analysis</h4>

<p>Verify the architecture models for internal consistency and accuracy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Perform trade-off analysis to resolve conflicts (if any) among the different views</li>

<li>Validate that the models support the principles, objectives, and constraints</li>

<li>Note changes to the viewpoint represented in the selected models from the Architecture Repository, and document</li>

<li>Test architecture models for completeness against requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>Identify gaps between the Baseline and Target, using the gap analysis technique as described in <a href="pt3.html">Part III</a>,
<a href="chap23.html#tag_23"><i>23. Gap Analysis</i></a> .</p>

<h4><a name="tag_09_03_05"></a>9.3.5 Define Candidate Roadmap Components</h4>

<p>Following the creation of a Baseline Architecture, Target Architecture, and gap analysis, a data roadmap is required to
prioritize activities over the coming phases.</p>

<p>This initial Data Architecture roadmap will be used as raw material to support more detailed definition of a consolidated,
cross-discipline roadmap within the Opportunities &amp; Solutions phase.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_09_03_06"></a>9.3.6 Resolve Impacts Across the Architecture Landscape</h4>

<p>Once the Data Architecture is finalized, it is necessary to understand any wider impacts or implications.</p>

<p>At this stage, other architecture artifacts in the Architecture Landscape should be examined to identify:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does this Data Architecture create an impact on any pre-existing architectures?</li>

<li>Have recent changes been made that impact the Data Architecture?</li>

<li>Are there any opportunities to leverage work from this Data Architecture in other areas of the organization?</li>

<li>Does this Data Architecture impact other projects (including those planned as well as those currently in progress)?</li>

<li>Will this Data Architecture be impacted by other projects (including those planned as well as those currently in
progress)?</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="tag_09_03_07"></a>9.3.7 Conduct Formal Stakeholder Review</h4>

<p>Check the original motivation for the architecture project and the Statement of Architecture Work against the proposed Data
Architecture. Conduct an impact analysis to identify any areas where the Business and Application Architectures (e.g., business
practices) may need to change to cater for changes in the Data Architecture (for example, changes to forms or procedures,
applications, or database systems).</p>

<p>If the impact is significant, this may warrant the Business and Application Architectures being revisited.</p>

<p>Identify any areas where the Application Architecture (if generated at this point) may need to change to cater for changes in
the Data Architecture (or to identify constraints on the Application Architecture about to be designed).</p>

<p>If the impact is significant, it may be appropriate to drop into a short iteration of the Application Architecture at this
point.</p>

<p>Identify any constraints on the Technology Architecture about to be designed, refining the proposed Data Architecture only if
necessary.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_09_03_08"></a>9.3.8 Finalize the Data Architecture</h4>

<ul>
<li>Select standards for each of the building blocks, re-using as much as possible from the reference models selected from the
Architecture Repository</li>

<li>Fully document each building block</li>

<li>Conduct a final cross-check of overall architecture against business requirements; document the rationale for building block
decisions in the architecture document</li>

<li>Document the final requirements traceability report</li>

<li>Document the final mapping of the architecture within the Architecture Repository; from the selected building blocks, identify
those that might be re-used, and publish via the Architecture Repository</li>

<li>Finalize all the work products, such as gap analysis</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="tag_09_03_09"></a>9.3.9 Create the Architecture Definition Document</h4>

<p>Document the rationale for building block decisions in the Architecture Definition Document.</p>

<p>Prepare the Data Architecture sections of the Architecture Definition Document, comprising some or all of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Business data model</li>

<li>Logical data model</li>

<li>Data management process model</li>

<li>Data Entity/Business Function matrix</li>

<li>Data interoperability requirements (e.g., XML schema, security policies)</li>

<li>If appropriate, use reports and/or graphics generated by modeling tools to demonstrate key views of the architecture; route the
document for review by relevant stakeholders, and incorporate feedback</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="tag_09_05"></a>9.5 Approach</h3>

<h4><a name="tag_09_05_01"></a>9.5.1 Key Considerations for Data Architecture</h4>

<h5 class="header4"><a name="tag_09_05_01_01"></a>9.5.1.1 Data Management</h5>

<p>When an enterprise has chosen to undertake largescale architectural transformation, it is important to understand and address
data management issues. A structured and comprehensive approach to data management enables the effective use of data to capitalize
on its competitive advantages.</p>

<p>Considerations include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A clear definition of which application components in the landscape will serve as the system of record or reference for
enterprise master data</li>

<li>Will there be an enterprise-wide standard that all application components, including software packages, need to adopt? 

<p>(In the main, packages can be prescriptive about the data models and may not be flexible.)</p>
</li>

<li>Clearly understand how data entities are utilized by business functions, processes, and services</li>

<li>Clearly understand how and where enterprise data entities are created, stored, transported, and reported</li>

<li>What is the level and complexity of data transformations required to support the information exchange needs between
applications?</li>

<li>What will be the requirement for software in supporting data integration with the enterprise's customers and suppliers (e.g.,
use of ETL tools during the data migration, data profiling tools to evaluate data quality, etc.)?</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="header4"><a name="tag_09_05_01_02"></a>9.5.1.2 Data Migration</h5>

<p>When an existing application is replaced, there will be a critical need to migrate data (master, transactional, and reference)
to the new application. The Data Architecture should identify data migration requirements and also provide indicators as to the
level of transformation, weeding, and cleansing that will be required to present data in a format that meets the requirements and
constraints of the target application. The objective being that the target application has quality data when it is populated.
Another key consideration is to ensure that an enterprise-wide common data definition is established to support the
transformation.</p>

<h5 class="header4"><a name="tag_09_05_01_03"></a>9.5.1.3 Data Governance</h5>

<p>Data governance considerations ensure that the enterprise has the necessary dimensions in place to enable the transformation, as
follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Structure</b>: this dimension pertains to whether the enterprise has the necessary organizational structure and the
standards bodies to manage data entity aspects of the transformation</li>

<li><b>Management System</b>: here enterprises should have the necessary management system and data-related programs to manage the
governance aspects of data entities throughout its lifecycle</li>

<li><b>People</b>: this dimension addresses what data-related skills and roles the enterprise requires for the transformation 

<p>If the enterprise lacks such resources and skills, the enterprise should consider either acquiring those critical skills or
training existing internal resources to meet the requirements through a well-defined learning program.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="tag_09_05_02"></a>9.5.2 Architecture Repository</h4>

<p>As part of this phase, the architecture team will need to consider what relevant Data Architecture resources are available in
the organization's Architecture Repository (see <a href="pt5.html">Part V</a>, <a href="chap37.html#tag_37"><i>37. Architecture
Repository</i></a>), in particular, generic data models relevant to the organization's industry "vertical" sector. For
example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Energistics&reg; - Data Exchange Standards for the Upstream Oil &amp; Gas Industry</li>

<li>National Information Exchange Model (US Government)</li>

<li>The ARTS Operational Data Model and the ARTS Data Warehouse Model (Retail)</li>
</ul>
