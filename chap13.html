<h3><a name="tag_13_03"></a>13.3 Steps</h3>

<p>The level of detail addressed in Phase F will depend on the scope and goals of the overall architecture effort.</p>

<p>The order of the steps in Phase F as well as the time at which they are formally started and completed should be adapted to the
situation at hand in accordance with the established Architecture Governance.</p>

<p>All activities that have been initiated in these steps must be closed during the "Complete the architecture development cycle
and document lessons learned step" (see <a href="#tag_13_03_07">13.3.7 Complete the Architecture Development Cycle and Document
Lessons Learned</a>).</p>

<p>The steps in Phase F are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#tag_13_03_01">13.3.1 Confirm
Management Framework Interactions for the Implementation and Migration Plan</a></li>

<li><a href="#tag_13_03_02">13.3.2 Assign a Business Value to Each Work
Package</a></li>

<li><a href="#tag_13_03_03">13.3.3 Estimate
Resource Requirements, Project Timings, and Availability/Delivery Vehicle</a></li>

<li>Prioritize the migration projects through the conduct of a cost/benefit assessment and risk validation (see <a href=
"#tag_13_03_04">13.3.4 Prioritize the Migration Projects through the Conduct of a Cost/Benefit Assessment and Risk Validation</a>
</li>

<li><a href="#tag_13_03_05">13.3.5 Confirm
Architecture Roadmap and Update Architecture Definition Document</a></li>

<li><a href="#tag_13_03_06">13.3.6 Complete the Implementation and Migration
Plan</a></li>

<li><a href="#tag_13_03_07">13.3.7 Complete the
Architecture Development Cycle and Document Lessons Learned</a></li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="tag_13_03_01"></a>13.3.1 Confirm Management Framework Interactions for the Implementation and Migration Plan</h4>

<p>This step is about co-ordinating the Implementation and Migration Plan with the management frameworks within the organization.
There are typically four management frameworks that have to work closely together for the Implementation and Migration Plan to
succeed:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Business Planning</b> that conceives, directs, and provides the resources for all of the activities required to achieve
concrete business objectives/outcomes</li>

<li><b>Enterprise Architecture</b> that structures and gives context to all enterprise activities delivering concrete business
outcomes primarily but not exclusively in the IT domain</li>

<li><b>Project/Portfolio Management</b> that co-ordinates, designs, and builds the business systems that deliver the concrete
business outcomes</li>

<li><b>Operations Management</b> that integrates, operates, and maintains the deliverables that deliver the concrete business
outcomes</li>
</ul>

<p>The Implementation and Migration Plan will impact the outputs of each of these frameworks and consequently has to be reflected
in them. In the course of this step, understand the frameworks within the organization and ensure that these plans are co-ordinated
and inserted (in a summary format) within the plans of each one of these frameworks.</p>

<p>The outcome of this step may well be that the Implementation and Migration Plan could be part of a different plan produced by
another one of the frameworks with Enterprise Architecture participation.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_13_03_02"></a>13.3.2 Assign a Business Value to Each Work Package</h4>

<p>Establish and assign a business value to each of the work packages. The intent is to first establish what constitutes business
value within the organization, how value can be measured, and then apply this to each one of the projects and project
increments.</p>

<p>If Capability-Based Planning has been used, then the business values associated with the capabilities and associated capability
increments should be used to assign the business values for deliverables.</p>

<p>There are several issues to address in this activity:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Performance Evaluation Criteria</b> are used by portfolio and capability managers to approve and monitor the progress of the
architecture transformation</li>

<li><b>Return-on-Investment Criteria</b> have to be detailed and signed off by the various executive stakeholders</li>

<li><b>Business Value</b> has to be defined as well as techniques, such as the value chain, which are to be used to illustrate the
role in achieving tangible business outcomes 

<p>Business value will be used by portfolio and capability managers to allocate resources and, in cases where there are cutbacks,
business value in conjunction with return on investment can be used to determine whether an endeavor proceeds, is delayed, or is
canceled.</p>
</li>

<li><b>Critical Success Factors (CSFs)</b> should be established to define success for a project and/or project increment 

<p>These will provide managers and implementers with a gauge as to what constitutes a successful implementation.</p>
</li>

<li><b>Measures of Effectiveness (MOE)</b> are often performance criteria and many corporations include them in the CSFs 

<p>Where they are treated discretely, it should be clear as to how these criteria are to be grouped.</p>
</li>

<li><b>Strategic Fit</b> based upon the overall Enterprise Architecture (all tiers) will be the critical factor for allowing the
approval of any new project or initiative and for determining the value of any deliverable</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the work packages as a basis of identifying projects that will be in the Implementation and Migration Plan. The identified
projects will be fully developed in other steps in Phase F. The projects, and project increments, may require adjustment of the
Architecture Roadmap and Architecture Definition Document.</p>

<p>Risks should then be assigned to the projects and project increments by aggregating risks identified in the Consolidated Gaps,
Solutions, and Dependencies Matrix (from Phase E).</p>

<p>Estimate the business value for each project using the Business Value Assessment Technique (see <a href="pt3.html">Part III</a>,
<a href="chap24.html#tag_24_05"><i>24.5 Business Value Assessment Technique</i></a>).</p>

<h4><a name="tag_13_03_03"></a>13.3.3 Estimate Resource Requirements, Project Timings, and Availability/Delivery Vehicle</h4>

<p>This step determines the required resources and times for each project and their increments and provides the initial cost
estimates. The costs should be broken down into capital (to create the capability) and operations and maintenance (to run and
sustain the capability). Opportunities should be identified where the costs associated with delivering new and/or better capability
can be offset by decommissioning existing systems. Assign required resources to each activity and aggregate them at the project
increment and project level.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_13_03_04"></a>13.3.4 Prioritize the Migration Projects through the Conduct of a Cost/Benefit Assessment and Risk
Validation</h4>

<p>Prioritize the projects by ascertaining their business value against the cost of delivering them. The approach is to first
determine, as clearly as possible, the net benefit of all of the SBBs delivered by the projects, and then verify that the risks
have been effectively mitigated and factored in. Afterwards, the intent is to gain the requisite consensus to create a prioritized
list of projects that will provide the basis for resource allocation.</p>

<p>It is important to discover all costs, and to ensure that decision-makers understand the net benefit over time.</p>

<p>Review the risks to ensure that the risks for the project deliverables have been mitigated as much as possible. The project list
is then updated with risk-related comments.</p>

<p>Have the stakeholders agree upon a prioritization of the projects. Prioritization criteria will use elements identified in
creation of the draft Architecture Roadmap in Phase E as well as those relating to individual stakeholders' agendas. Notice that it
is possible for a project to earn a high priority if it provides a critical deliverable on the path to some large benefit, even if
the immediate benefit of the project itself is small.</p>

<p>Formally review the risk assessment and revise it as necessary ensuring that there is a full understanding of the residual risk
associated with the prioritization and the projected funding line.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_13_03_05"></a>13.3.5 Confirm Architecture Roadmap and Update Architecture Definition Document</h4>

<p>Update the Architecture Roadmap including any Transition Architectures. Review the work to date to assess what the time-spans
between Transition Architecture should be, taking into consideration the increments in business value and capability and other
factors, such as risk. Once the capability increments have been finalized, consolidate the deliverables by project. This will
result in a revised Architecture Roadmap.</p>

<p>This is needed in order to co-ordinate the development of several concurrent instances of the various architectures. A
Transition Architecture State Evolution Table (see <a href="pt3.html">Part III</a>, <a href="chap24.html#tag_24_04"><i>24.4
Transition Architecture State Evolution Table</i></a>) can be used to show the proposed state of the domain architectures at
various levels of detail.</p>

<p>If the implementation approach has shifted as a result of confirming the implementation increments, update the Architecture
Definition Document. This may include assigning project objectives and aligning projects and their deliverables with the Transition
Architectures to create an Architecture Definition Increments Table (see <a href="pt3.html">Part III</a>, <a href=
"chap24.html#tag_24_03"><i>24.3 Architecture Definition Increments Table</i></a>).</p>

<h4><a name="tag_13_03_06"></a>13.3.6 Complete the Implementation and Migration Plan</h4>

<p>Generate the completed Implementation and Migration Plan. Much of the detail for the plan has already been gathered and this
step brings it all together using accepted planning and management techniques.</p>

<p>This should include integrating all of the projects and activities as well as dependencies and impact of change into a project
plan. Any Transition Architectures will act as portfolio milestones.</p>

<p>All external dependencies should be captured and included, and the overall availability of resources assessed. Project plans may
be included within the Implementation and Migration Plan.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_13_03_07"></a>13.3.7 Complete the Architecture Development Cycle and Document Lessons Learned</h4>

<p>This step transitions governance from the development of the architecture to the realization of the architecture. If the
maturity of the Architecture Capability warrants, an Implementation Governance Model may be produced (see <a href="pt4.html">Part
IV</a>, <a href="chap32.html#tag_32_02_15"><i>32.2.15 Implementation Governance Model</i></a>).</p>

<p>Lessons learned during the development of the architecture should be documented and captured by the appropriate governance
process in Phase H as inputs to managing the Architecture Capability.</p>

<p>The detail of the Architecture Roadmap and the Implementation and Migration Plan should be expressed at a similar level of
detail to the Architecture Definition Document developed in Phases B, C, and D. Where significant additional detail is required by
the next phase the architecture is likely transitioning to a different level. Depending upon the level of the Target Architecture
and Implementation and Migration Plan it may be necessary to iterate another ADM cycle at a lower level of detail. See <a href=
"pt3.html">Part III</a>, <a href="chap18.html#tag_18"><i>18. Applying Iteration to the ADM</i></a> and <a href=
"chap19.html#tag_19"><i>19. Applying the ADM Across the Architecture Landscape</i></a> for techniques to manage iteration and
different levels of detail.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_13_05"></a>13.5 Approach</h3>

<p>The focus of Phase F is the creation of an Implementation and Migration Plan in co-operation with the project and portfolio
managers.</p>

<p>Phase E provides an incomplete Architecture Roadmap and Implementation and Migration Plan that address the Statement of
Architecture Work. In Phase F this Roadmap and the Implementation and Migration Plan are integrated with the enterprise's other
change activity.</p>

<p>Activities include assessing the dependencies, costs, and benefits of the various migration projects within the context of the
enterprise's other activity. The Architecture Roadmap, Version 0.1 and Implementation and Migration Plan, Version 0.1 from Phase E
will form the basis of the final Implementation and Migration Plan that will include portfolio and project-level detail.</p>

<p>The architecture development cycle should then be completed and lessons learned documented to enable continuous process
improvement. <!--page
