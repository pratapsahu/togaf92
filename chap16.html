<p class="tent">A "gap requirement" is anything that has been eliminated by accident, and therefore requires a change to the Target

<h3><a name="tag_16_04"></a>16.4 Outputs</h3>

<p class="tent">The outputs of the Requirements Management process may include, but are not restricted to:</p>

<ul>
<li class="tent">Requirements Impact Assessment (see <a href="pt4.html">Part IV</a>, <a href="chap32.html#tag_32_02_18"><i>32.2.18
Requirements Impact Assessment</i></a>)</li>

<li class="tent">Updated Architecture Requirements Specification (see <a href="pt4.html">Part IV</a>, <a href=
"chap32.html#tag_32_02_06"><i>32.2.6 Architecture Requirements Specification</i></a>), if necessary</li>
</ul>

<p class="tent">The Architecture Requirements Repository will be updated as part of the Requirements Management phase and should
contain all requirements information.</p>

<p class="tent">When new requirements arise, or existing ones are changed, a Requirements Impact Statement is generated, which
identifies the phases of the ADM that need to be revisited to address the changes. The statement goes through various iterations
until the final version, which includes the full implications of the requirements (e.g., costs, timescales, and business metrics)
on the architecture development. Once requirements for the current ADM cycle have been finalized then the Architecture Requirements
Specification should be updated.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_16_05"></a>16.5 Approach</h3>

<h4><a name="tag_16_05_01"></a>16.5.1 General</h4>

<p class="tent">As indicated by the "Requirements Management" circle at the center of the ADM graphic, the ADM is continuously
driven by the Requirements Management process.</p>

<p class="tent">It is important to note that the Requirements Management circle denotes not a static set of requirements, but a
dynamic process whereby requirements for Enterprise Architecture and subsequent changes to those requirements are identified,
stored, and fed into and out of the relevant ADM phases, and also between cycles of the ADM.</p>

<p class="tent">The ability to deal with changes in requirements is crucial. Architecture is an activity that by its very nature
deals with uncertainty and change - the "grey area" between what stakeholders aspire to and what can be specified and engineered as
a solution. Architecture requirements are therefore invariably subject to change in practice. Moreover, architecture often deals
with drivers and constraints, many of which by their very nature are beyond the control of the enterprise (changing market
conditions, new legislation, etc.), and which can produce changes in requirements in an unforeseen manner.</p>

<p class="tent">Note also that the Requirements Management process itself does not dispose of, address, or prioritize any
requirements; this is done within the relevant phase of the ADM. It is merely the process for managing requirements throughout the
overall ADM.</p>

<p class="tent">It is recommended that an Architecture Requirements Repository (see <a href="pt4.html">Part IV</a>, <a href=
"chap37.html#tag_37_06"><i>37.6 The Architecture Requirements Repository</i></a>) is used to record and manage all architecture
requirements. Unlike the Architecture Requirements Specification, and the Requirements Impact Assessment, the Architecture
Requirements Repository can hold information from multiple ADM cycles.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_16_05_02"></a>16.5.2 Requirements Development</h4>

<p class="tent">The first high-level requirements are articulated as part of the Architecture Vision, generated by means of the
business scenario or analogous technique.</p>

<p class="tent">Each phase of the ADM, from Preliminary to Phase H, must select the approved requirements for that phase as held in
the Architecture Requirements Repository and Architecture Requirements Specification. At the completion of the phase the status of
all such requirements needs to be updated. During the phase execution, new requirements generated for future architecture work
within the scope of the current Statement of Architecture Work need to be documented within the Architecture Requirements
Specification, and new requirements which are outside of the scope of the current Statement of Architecture Work must be input to
the Architecture Requirements Repository for management through the Requirements Management process.</p>

<p class="tent">In each relevant phase of the ADM the architect should identify types of requirement that must be met by the
architecture, including applicable:</p>

<ul>
<li class="tent">Functional requirements</li>

<li class="tent">Non-functional requirements</li>
</ul>

<p class="tent">When defining requirements the architect should take into account:</p>

<ul>
<li class="tent">Assumptions for requirements</li>

<li class="tent">Constraints for requirements</li>

<li class="tent">Domain-specific principles that drive requirements</li>

<li class="tent">Policies affecting requirements</li>

<li class="tent">Standards that requirements must meet</li>

<li class="tent">Organization guidelines for requirements</li>

<li class="tent">Specifications for requirements</li>
</ul>

<p class="tent">Deliverables in later ADM phases also contain mappings to the design requirements, and may also generate new types
of requirements (for example, conformance requirements, time windows for implementation).</p>

<h4><a name="tag_16_05_03"></a>16.5.3 Resources</h4>

<p class="tent">The world of requirements engineering is rich with emerging recommendations and processes for Requirements
Management. The TOGAF standard does not mandate or recommend any specific process or tool; it simply states what an effective
Requirements Management process should achieve (i.e., the "requirements for requirements", if you like).</p>

<h5 class="header4"><a name="tag_16_05_03_01"></a>16.5.3.1 Business Scenarios</h5>

<p class="tent">The business scenarios technique is an appropriate and effective technique to discover and document business
requirements. Business scenarios are described in detail in the TOGAF&reg; Series Guide: Business Scenarios.</p>

<h5 class="header4"><a name="tag_16_05_03_02"></a>16.5.3.2 Requirements Tools</h5>

<p class="tent">There is a large, and increasing, number of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) tools available for the support of
Requirements Management, albeit not necessarily designed for architecture requirements. The Volere website has a very useful list
of leading requirements tools (see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.volere.co.uk">www.volere.co.uk/tools.htm</a>). <!--page
