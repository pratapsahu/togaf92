<p>This chapter provides an introduction to the guidelines and techniques provided in <a href="pt3.html">Part III: ADM Guidelines
&amp; Techniques</a>.<a href="#tag_foot_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a></p>

<h3><a name="tag_17_01"></a>17.1 Guidelines for Adapting the ADM Process</h3>

<p>The Architecture Development Method (ADM) process can be adapted to deal with a number of different usage scenarios, including
different process styles (e.g., the use of iteration) and also specific specialist architectures (such as security). Guidelines
included within this part are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Applying Iteration to the ADM (see <a href="chap18.html#tag_18"><i>18. Applying Iteration to the ADM</i></a>) discusses the
concept of iteration and shows potential strategies for applying iterative concepts to the ADM</li>

<li>Applying the ADM across the Architecture Landscape (see <a href="chap19.html#tag_19"><i>19. Applying the ADM Across the
Architecture Landscape</i></a>) discusses the different types of architecture engagement that may occur at different levels of the
enterprise - this section then also discusses how the ADM process can be focused to support different types of engagement</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="tag_17_02"></a>17.2 Techniques for Architecture Development</h3>

<p>The following techniques are described within <a href="pt3.html">Part III: ADM Guidelines &amp; Techniques</a> to support
specific tasks within the ADM:</p>

<ul>
<li>Architecture Principles (see <a href="chap20.html#tag_20"><i>20. Architecture Principles</i></a>) - principles for the use and
deployment of IT resources across the enterprise - describes how to develop the set of general rules and guidelines for the
architecture being developed</li>

<li>Stakeholder Management (see <a href="chap21.html#tag_21"><i>21. Stakeholder Management</i></a>) describes stakeholder
management, an important discipline that successful architecture practitioners can use to win support for their projects</li>

<li>Architecture Patterns (see <a href="chap22.html#tag_22"><i>22. Architecture Patterns</i></a>) provides guidance on using
architectural patterns</li>

<li>Gap Analysis (see <a href="chap23.html#tag_23"><i>23. Gap Analysis</i></a>) describes the technique known as gap analysis; it
is widely used in the TOGAF ADM to validate an architecture that is being developed</li>

<li>Migration Planning Techniques (see <a href="chap24.html#tag_24"><i>24. Migration Planning Techniques</i></a>) describes a
number of techniques to support migration planning in Phases E and F</li>

<li>Interoperability Requirements (see <a href="chap25.html#tag_25"><i>25. Interoperability Requirements</i></a>) describes a
technique for determining interoperability requirements</li>

<li>Business Transformation Readiness Assessment (see <a href="chap26.html#tag_26"><i>26. Business Transformation Readiness
Assessment</i></a>) describes a technique for identifying business transformation issues</li>

<li>Risk Management (see <a href="chap27.html#tag_27"><i>27. Risk Management</i></a>) describes a technique for managing risk
during an architecture/business transformation project</li>

<li>Capability-Based Planning (see <a href="chap28.html#tag_28"><i>28. Capability-Based Planning</i></a>) describes the technique
of capability-based planning</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="tag_17_03"></a>17.3 Using the TOGAF Framework with Different Architectural Styles</h3>

<p>The TOGAF framework is designed to be flexible and it can be used with various architectural styles. Further information can be
found in the following Guides:</p>

<ul>
<li>Integrating Risk and Security within a TOGAF&reg; Enterprise Architecture</li>

<li>TOGAF&reg; Series Guide: Using the TOGAF&reg; Framework to Define and Govern Service-Oriented Architectures</li>
</ul>

<p>Architectural styles differ in terms of focus, form, techniques, materials, subject, and time period. Some styles can be
considered as fashionable, others focused on particular aspects of Enterprise Architecture. The TOGAF standard is a generic
framework intended to be used in a wide variety of environments. It is a flexible and extensible framework that can be readily
adapted to a number of architectural styles.</p>

<p>An organization's Architecture Landscape can be expected to contain architecture work that is developed in many architectural
styles. The TOGAF standard ensures that the needs of each stakeholder are appropriately addressed in the context of other
stakeholders and the Baseline Architecture.</p>

<p>When using the TOGAF standard to support a specific architectural style the practitioner must take into account the combination
of distinctive features in which architecture is performed or expressed. As a first step, the distinctive features of a style must
be identified.</p>

<p>For example, The Open Group definition for SOA identifies the following distinctive features:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is based on the design of the services - which mirror real-world business activities - comprising the enterprise (or
inter-enterprise) business processes</li>

<li>Service representation utilizes business descriptions to provide context (i.e., business process, goal, rule, policy, service
interface, and service component) and implements services using service orchestration</li>

<li>It places unique requirements on the infrastructure - it is recommended that implementations use open standards to realize
interoperability and location transparency</li>

<li>Implementations are environment-specific - they are constrained or enabled by context and must be described within that
context</li>
</ul>

<p>The second step is determining how these distinctive features will be addressed. Addressing a distinctive style should not call
for significant changes to the TOGAF framework; instead it should adjust the models, viewpoints, and tools used by the
practitioner.</p>

<p>In Phase B, Phase C, and Phase D the practitioner is expected to select the relevant architecture resources, including models,
viewpoints, and tools, to properly describe the architecture domain and demonstrate that stakeholder concerns are addressed (see <a
href="pt2.html">Part II</a>, <a href="chap07.html#tag_07_03_01"><i>7.3.1 Select Reference Models, Viewpoints, and Tools</i></a> ,
<a href="chap09.html#tag_09_03_01"><i>9.3.1 Select Reference Models, Viewpoints, and Tools</i></a> , <a href=
"chap10.html#tag_10_03_01"><i>10.3.1 Select Reference Models, Viewpoints, and Tools</i></a> , and <a href=
"chap11.html#tag_11_03_01"><i>11.3.1 Select Reference Models, Viewpoints, and Tools</i></a>). Depending upon the distinctive
features, different architectural styles will add new elements that must be described, highlight existing elements, adjust the
notation used to describe the architecture, and focus the architect on some stakeholders or stakeholder concerns.</p>

<p>Addressing the distinctive features will usually include extensions to the Architecture Content Metamodel and the use of
specific notation or modeling techniques and the identification of viewpoints. Whether the style is dominant will determine whether
it is necessary to revisit the Preliminary Phase and make changes to the Architecture Capability or whether support for the
distinctive feature is possible within the scope of selection expected within a single ADM cycle.</p>

<p>Style-specific reference models and maturity models are commonly used tools that support a practitioner.</p>

<p>During the lifetime of the TOGAF framework many architectural styles have been developed to address key problems facing
practitioners and to demonstrate how the TOGAF framework can be made more relevant within defined contexts.</p>

<p>Some of these have been developed by The Open Group Forums and Work Groups working in specific areas and have been published in
Guides, White Papers, and Standards. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li>TOGAF&reg; Series Guide: Using the TOGAF&reg; Framework to Define and Govern Service-Oriented Architectures</li>

<li>Integrating Risk and Security within a TOGAF&reg; Enterprise Architecture</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these have been developed collaboratively between The Open Group and other bodies. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li>TOGAF&reg; and SABSA&reg; Integration</li>

<li>Integrating the TOGAF&reg; Standard with the BIAN Service Landscape</li>

<li>Exploring Synergies between TOGAF&reg; and Frameworx</li>

<li>TOGAF&reg; 9 and DoDAF 2.0</li>
</ul>

<p>The TOGAF Library (see <a target="_blank" href=
"https://publications.opengroup.org/togaf-library">https://publications.opengroup.org/togaf-library</a>) includes an evolving list
of documents providing advice and guidance for the application of the TOGAF framework within specific contexts.</p>
