<h3><a name="tag_18_01"></a>18.1 Overview</h3>

<p>The graphical representation of the TOGAF ADM, as shown in <a href="chap04.html#tagfcjh_7"><i>Figure 4-1</i></a> , and the
description of the ADM phases discretely in order in <a href="pt2.html">Part II</a>, can be read to imply a deterministic waterfall
methodology. This method of presentation is provided for the purpose of quickly communicating the basics of architecture
development and the architecture lifecycle. In practice, two key concepts are used to manage the complexity of developing an
Enterprise Architecture and managing its lifecycle - iteration and levels (see <a href="chap19.html#tag_19"><i>19. Applying the ADM
Across the Architecture Landscape</i></a>). The two concepts are tightly linked.</p>

<p>The ADM supports a number of concepts that are characterized as iteration. First, iteration describes the process of both
describing a comprehensive Architecture Landscape through multiple ADM cycles based upon individual initiatives bound to the scope
of the Request for Architecture Work. Second, iteration describes the integrated process of developing an architecture where the
activities described in different ADM phases interact to produce an integrated architecture. In order to concisely describe the
activity and outputs, this latter iteration is described in sequential terms. Third, iteration describes the process of managing
change to the organization's Architecture Capability.</p>

<p>Iteration to develop a comprehensive Architecture Landscape:</p>

<ul>
<li>Projects will exercise through the entire ADM cycle, commencing with Phase A 

<p>Each cycle of the ADM will be bound by a Request for Architecture Work. The architecture output will populate the Architecture
Landscape, either extending the landscape described, or changing the landscape where required.</p>
</li>

<li>Separate projects may operate their own ADM cycles concurrently, with relationships between the different projects</li>

<li>One project may trigger the initiation of another project 

<p>Typically, this is used when higher-level architecture initiatives identify opportunities or solutions that require more
detailed architecture, or when a project identifies landscape impacts outside the scope of its Request for Architecture Work.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Iteration within an ADM cycle (Architecture Development iteration):</p>

<ul>
<li>Projects may operate multiple ADM phases concurrently 

<p>Typically, this is used to manage the inter-relationship between Business Architecture, Information Systems Architecture, and
Technology Architecture.</p>
</li>

<li>Projects may cycle between ADM phases, in planned cycles covering multiple phases 

<p>Typically, this is used to converge on a detailed Target Architecture when higher-level architecture does not exist to provide
context and constraint.</p>
</li>

<li>Projects may return to previous phases in order to circle back and update work products with new information 

<p>Typically, this is used to converge on an executable Architecture Roadmap or Implementation and Migration Plan, when the
implementation details and scope of change trigger a change or re-prioritization of stakeholder requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Iteration to manage the Architecture Capability (Architecture Capability iteration):</p>

<ul>
<li>Projects may require a new iteration of the Preliminary Phase to (re-)establish aspects of the Architecture Capability
identified in Phase A to address a Request for Architecture Work</li>

<li>Projects may require a new iteration of the Preliminary Phase to adjust the organization's Architecture Capability as a result
of identifying new or changed requirements for Architecture Capability as a result of a Change Request in Phase H</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="tag_18_02"></a>18.2 Iteration Cycles</h3>

<p>The suggested iteration cycles for the TOGAF ADM are shown in <a href="#tagfcjh_22">Figure 18-1</a> , and can be used to
effectively group related architectural activities to achieve a specific purpose. These iteration cycles are referenced in <a href=
"#tag_18_03">18.3 Classes of Architecture Engagement</a> and <a href="#tag_18_05">18.5 Iteration Considerations</a> .</p>

<center><a href="Figures/19_adm_iteration.png" target="new"><img src="Figures/19_adm_iteration.png" border="0" width="50%">
</a></center>

<br>
<br>
 

<center><small><i><a name="tagfcjh_22"></a> Figure 18-1: Iteration Cycles</i></small></center>

<ul>
<li><b>Architecture Capability</b> iterations support the creation<a href="#tag_foot_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> and
evolution of the required Architecture Capability 

<p>This includes the initial mobilization of the architecture activity for a given purpose or architecture engagement type by
establishing or adjusting the architecture approach, principles, scope, vision, and governance.</p>
</li>

<li><b>Architecture Development</b> iterations allow the creation of architecture content by cycling through, or integrating,
Business, Information Systems, and Technology Architecture phases 

<p>These iterations ensure that the architecture is considered as a whole. In this type of iteration stakeholder reviews are
typically broader. As the iterations converge on a target, extensions into the Opportunities &amp; Solutions and Migration Planning
phases ensure that the architecture's implementability is considered as the architecture is finalized.</p>
</li>

<li><b>Transition Planning</b> iterations support the creation of formal change roadmaps for a defined architecture</li>

<li><b>Architecture Governance</b> iterations support governance of change activity progressing towards a defined Target
Architecture</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="tag_18_03"></a>18.3 Classes of Architecture Engagement</h3>

<p>An architecture function or services organization may be called upon to assist an enterprise in a number of different contexts,
as the architectures developed can range from summary to detail, broad to narrow coverage, and current state to future state. In
these contexts the concept of iteration should be used in developing the architecture.</p>

<p>Typically, there are three areas of engagement for architects:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Identification of Required Change</b>: outside the context of any change initiative, architecture can be used as a technique
to provide visibility of the IT capability in order to support strategic decision-making and alignment of execution</li>

<li><b>Definition of Change</b>: where a need to change has been identified, architecture can be used as a technique to define the
nature and extent of change in a structured fashion 

<p>Within largescale change initiatives, architectures can be developed to provide detailed Architecture Definition for change
initiatives that are bounded by the scope of a program or portfolio.</p>
</li>

<li><b>Implementation of Change</b>: architecture at all levels of the enterprise can be used as a technique to provide design
governance to change initiatives by providing big-picture visibility, supplying structural constraints, and defining criteria on
which to evaluate technical decisions</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#tagfcjh_23">Figure 18-2</a> and the following table show the classes of Enterprise Architecture engagement.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_18_04"></a>18.4 Approaches to Architecture Development</h3>

<p class="tent">Two approaches can be adopted within the ADM for the development of architectures:</p>

<ul>
<li class="tent"><b>Baseline First</b>: in this style, an assessment of the baseline landscape is used to identify problem areas
and improvement opportunities 

<p class="tent">This process is most suitable when the baseline is complex, not clearly understood, or agreed upon. This approach
is common where organizational units have had a high degree of autonomy.</p>
</li>

<li class="tent"><b>Target First</b>: in this style, the target solution is elaborated in detail and then mapped back to the
baseline, in order to identify change activity 

<p class="tent">This process is suitable when a target state is agreed at a high level and where the enterprise wishes to
effectively transition to the target model.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class="tent">Typically, if the baseline is broadly understood a higher value will be obtained focusing on the target first then
baseline to the extent necessary to identify changes.</p>

<p class="tent">In practical terms, an architecture team will always give informal consideration to the baseline when analyzing the
target (and <i>vice versa</i>). In situations where baseline and target are expected to be considered in parallel by stakeholders,
it is recommended that the architecture team focuses priority on one state in order to maintain focus and consistency of
execution.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_18_05"></a>18.5 Iteration Considerations</h3>

<p class="tent">Some iteration cycles can be executed once, whereas others have a natural minimum number of cycles. For some
iteration cycles, each iteration follows the same process; where there is more than one iteration within a cycle, the process
differs slightly for each of the iterations.</p>

<p class="tent">When considering the usage of iteration cycles, it is also necessary to consider where to place appropriate
checkpoints within the process. If the expected level of stakeholder involvement is high, it may be sensible to carry out very
frequent but informal checkpoints to ensure that the process is moving in the intended direction. If stakeholders are less closely
involved, then checkpoints may be less frequent but more formal. Checkpoints at the completion of each iteration cycle, or at the
end of several iteration cycles, are common.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_18_05_01"></a>18.5.1 Iteration between ADM Cycles</h4>

<p class="tent">Each iteration completes an ADM cycle at a single level of Architecture Description. This approach to the ADM uses
Phase F (Migration Planning) to initiate new more detailed architecture development projects. This approach is illustrated in <a
href="#tagfcjh_24">Figure 18-3</a> . This type of iteration highlights the need for higher-level architecture to guide and
constrain more detailed architecture. It also highlights that the complete Architecture Landscape is developed by multiple ADM
iterations.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_18_05_02"></a>18.5.2 Iteration within an ADM Cycle</h4>

<p class="tent">Each iteration cycle crosses multiple TOGAF ADM phases. The following tables show at a high level which phases
should be completed for which iteration cycle, showing activity that is core (i.e., the primary focus of the iteration), activity
that is light (i.e., the secondary focus of the iteration), and activity that may be informally conducted (i.e., some activity may
be carried out, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the ADM).</p>

<h3><a name="tag_18_06"></a>18.6 Conclusions</h3>

<p class="tent">All of these techniques are valid applications of the ADM. Combined together, they represent how the ADM can be
used in practice. The ADM should always be used in an iterative process. How this process is exercised is dependent upon
organizational factors. Particular factors for consideration include:</p>

<ul>
<li class="tent"><b>The formality and nature of established process checkpoints within the organization</b> 

<p class="tent">Does the organization mandate that certain groups of activities are carried out between checkpoints? Does the
organization mandate that certain activities must be finalized before other activities can be carried out?</p>
</li>

<li class="tent"><b>The level of stakeholder involvement expected within the process</b> 

<p class="tent">Are stakeholders expecting to be closely involved within the development of a solution, or are they expecting to
