<p>This chapter provides descriptions of deliverables referenced in the Architecture Development Method (ADM).</p>

<h3><a name="tag_32_01"></a>32.1 Introduction</h3>

<p>This chapter defines the deliverables that will typically be consumed and produced across the TOGAF ADM cycle. As deliverables
are typically the contractual or formal work products of an architecture project, it is likely that these deliverables will be
constrained or altered by any overarching project or process management for the enterprise (such as CMMI, PRINCE2, PMBOK, or
MSP).</p>

<p>This chapter therefore is intended to provide a typical baseline of architecture deliverables in order to better define the
activities required in the ADM and act as a starting point for tailoring within a specific organization.</p>

<p>The TOGAF Content Framework (see <a href="pt4.html">Part IV</a>, <a href="chap29.html#tag_29"><i>29. Introduction to Part
IV</i></a>) identifies deliverables that are produced as outputs from executing the ADM cycle and potentially consumed as inputs
at other points in the ADM. Other deliverables may be produced elsewhere and consumed by the ADM.</p>

<p>Deliverables produced by executing the ADM are shown in the table below.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_32_02"></a>32.2 Deliverable Descriptions</h3>

<p>The following sections provide example descriptions of deliverables referenced in the ADM.</p>

<p>Note that not all the content described here need be contained in a particular deliverable. Rather, it is
recommended that external references be used where possible; for example, the strategic plans of a business should not be copied
into a Request for Architecture Work, but rather the title of the strategic plans should be referenced.</p>

<p>Also, it is not suggested that these descriptions should be followed to the letter. However, each element should be
considered carefully; ignoring any input or output item may cause problems downstream.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_32_02_01"></a>32.2.1 Architecture Building Blocks</h4>

<p>Architecture documentation and models from the enterprise's Architecture Repository; see <a href="pt4.html">Part
IV</a>, <a href="chap33.html#tag_33"><i>33. Building Blocks</i></a> .</p>

<h4><a name="tag_32_02_02"></a>32.2.2 Architecture Contract</h4>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_02_01"></a>Purpose</h5>

<p>Architecture Contracts are the joint agreements between development partners and sponsors on the deliverables,
quality, and fitness-for-purpose of an architecture. Successful implementation of these agreements will be delivered through
effective Architecture Governance (see <a href="pt5.html">Part VI</a>, <a href="chap44.html#tag_44"><i>44. Architecture
Governance</i></a>). By implementing a governed approach to the management of contracts, the following will be ensured:</p>

<ul>
<li>A system of continuous monitoring to check integrity, changes, decision-making, and audit of all
architecture-related activities within the organization</li>

<li>Adherence to the principles, standards, and requirements of the existing or developing architectures</li>

<li>Identification of risks in all aspects of the development and implementation of the architecture(s) covering the
internal development against accepted standards, policies, technologies, and products as well as the operational aspects of the
architectures such that the organization can continue its business within a resilient environment</li>

<li>A set of processes and practices that ensure accountability, responsibility, and discipline with regard to the
development and usage of all architectural artifacts</li>

<li>A formal understanding of the governance organization responsible for the contract, their level of authority, and
scope of the architecture under the governance of this body</li>
</ul>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_02_02"></a>Content</h5>

<p>Typical contents of an Architecture Design and Development Contract are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Introduction and background</li>

<li>The nature of the agreement</li>

<li>Scope of the architecture</li>

<li>Architecture and strategic principles and requirements</li>

<li>Conformance requirements</li>

<li>Architecture development and management process and roles</li>

<li>Target Architecture measures</li>

<li>Defined phases of deliverables</li>

<li>Prioritized joint workplan</li>

<li>Time window(s)</li>

<li>Architecture delivery and business metrics</li>
</ul>

<br>
 

<p>Typical contents of a Business Users' Architecture Contract are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Introduction and background</li>

<li>The nature of the agreement</li>

<li>Scope</li>

<li>Strategic requirements</li>

<li>Conformance requirements</li>

<li>Architecture adopters</li>

<li>Time window</li>

<li>Architecture business metrics</li>

<li>Service architecture (includes Service Level Agreement (SLA))</li>
</ul>

<p>For more detail on the use of Architecture Contracts, see <a href="pt5.html">Part VI</a>, <a href=
"chap43.html#tag_43"><i>43. Architecture Contracts</i></a> .</p>

<h4><a name="tag_32_02_03"></a>32.2.3 Architecture Definition Document</h4>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_03_01"></a>Purpose</h5>

<p>The Architecture Definition Document is the deliverable container for the core architectural artifacts created
during a project and for important related information. The Architecture Definition Document spans all architecture domains
(business, data, application, and technology) and also examines all relevant states of the architecture (baseline, transition, and
target).</p>

<p>A Transition Architecture shows the enterprise at an architecturally significant state between the Baseline and
Target Architectures. Transition Architectures are used to describe transitional Target Architectures necessary for effective
realization of the Target Architecture.</p>

<p>The Architecture Definition Document is a companion to the Architecture Requirements Specification, with a
complementary objective:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Architecture Definition Document provides a qualitative view of the solution and aims to communicate the
intent of the architects</li>

<li>The Architecture Requirements Specification provides a quantitative view of the solution, stating measurable
criteria that must be met during the implementation of the architecture</li>
</ul>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_03_02"></a>Content</h5>

<p>Typical contents of an Architecture Definition Document are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scope</li>

<li>Goals, objectives, and constraints</li>

<li>Architecture Principles</li>

<li>Baseline Architecture</li>

<li>Architecture models (for each state to be modeled): 

<ul>
<li>Business Architecture models</li>

<li>Data Architecture models</li>

<li>Application Architecture models</li>

<li>Technology Architecture models</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Rationale and justification for architectural approach</li>

<li>Mapping to Architecture Repository: 

<ul>
<li>Mapping to Architecture Landscape</li>

<li>Mapping to reference models</li>

<li>Mapping to standards</li>

<li>Re-use assessment</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Gap analysis</li>

<li>Impact assessment</li>

<li>Transition Architecture: 

<ul>
<li>Definition of transition states</li>

<li>Business Architecture for each transition state</li>

<li>Data Architecture for each transition state</li>

<li>Application Architecture for each transition state</li>

<li>Technology Architecture for each transition state</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<br>
 

<h4><a name="tag_32_02_04"></a>32.2.4 Architecture Principles</h4>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_04_01"></a>Purpose</h5>

<p>Principles are general rules and guidelines, intended to be enduring and seldom amended, that inform and support
the way in which an organization sets about fulfilling its mission.</p>

<p>In their turn, principles may be just one element in a structured set of ideas that collectively define and guide
the organization, from values through to actions and results.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_04_02"></a>Content</h5>

<p>See <a href="pt3.html">Part III</a>, <a href="chap20.html#tag_20"><i>20. Architecture Principles</i></a> for
guidelines and a detailed set of generic Architecture Principles, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Business principles (see <a href="chap20.html#tag_20_06_01"><i>20.6.1 Business Principles</i></a>)</li>

<li>Data principles (see <a href="chap20.html#tag_20_06_02"><i>20.6.2 Data Principles</i></a>)</li>

<li>Application principles (see <a href="chap20.html#tag_20_06_03"><i>20.6.3 Application Principles</i></a>)</li>

<li>Technology principles (see <a href="chap20.html#tag_20_06_04"><i>20.6.4 Technology Principles</i></a>)</li>
</ul>

<br>
 

<h4><a name="tag_32_02_05"></a>32.2.5 Architecture Repository</h4>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_05_01"></a>Purpose</h5>

<p>The Architecture Repository acts as a holding area for all architecture-related projects within the enterprise. The
repository allows projects to manage their deliverables, locate re-usable assets, and publish outputs to stakeholders and other
interested parties.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_05_02"></a>Content</h5>

<p>See <a href="pt5.html">Part V</a>, <a href="chap37.html#tag_37"><i>37. Architecture Repository</i></a> for a
detailed description of the content of an Architecture Repository.<br>
</p>

<h4><a name="tag_32_02_06"></a>32.2.6 Architecture Requirements Specification</h4>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_06_01"></a>Purpose</h5>

<p>The Architecture Requirements Specification provides a set of quantitative statements that outline what an
implementation project must do in order to comply with the architecture. An Architecture Requirements Specification will typically
form a major component of an implementation contract or contract for more detailed Architecture Definition.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the Architecture Requirements Specification is a companion to the Architecture Definition
Document, with a complementary objective:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Architecture Definition Document provides a qualitative view of the solution and aims to communicate the
intent of the architect</li>

<li>The Architecture Requirements Specification provides a quantitative view of the solution, stating measurable
criteria that must be met during the implementation of the architecture</li>
</ul>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_06_02"></a>Content</h5>

<p>Typical contents of an Architecture Requirements Specification are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Success measures</li>

<li>Architecture requirements</li>

<li>Business service contracts</li>

<li>Application service contracts</li>

<li>Implementation guidelines</li>

<li>Implementation specifications</li>

<li>Implementation standards</li>

<li>Interoperability requirements</li>

<li>IT Service Management requirements</li>

<li>Constraints</li>

<li>Assumptions</li>
</ul>

<br>
 

<h4><a name="tag_32_02_07"></a>32.2.7 Architecture Roadmap</h4>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_07_01"></a>Purpose</h5>

<p>The Architecture Roadmap lists individual work packages that will realize the Target Architecture and lays them out
on a timeline to show progression from the Baseline Architecture to the Target Architecture. The Architecture Roadmap highlights
individual work packages' business value at each stage. Transition Architectures necessary to effectively realize the Target
Architecture are identified as intermediate steps. The Architecture Roadmap is incrementally developed throughout Phases E and F,
and informed by readily identifiable roadmap components from Phase B, C, and D within the ADM.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_07_02"></a>Content</h5>

<p>Typical contents of an Architecture Roadmap are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Work package portfolio: 

<ul>
<li>Work package description (name, description, objectives, deliverables)</li>

<li>Functional requirements</li>

<li>Dependencies</li>

<li>Relationship to opportunity</li>

<li>Relationship to Architecture Definition Document and Architecture Requirements Specification</li>

<li>Business value</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Implementation Factor Assessment and Deduction matrix, including: 

<ul>
<li>Risks</li>

<li>Issues</li>

<li>Assumptions</li>

<li>Dependencies</li>

<li>Actions</li>

<li>Inputs</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Consolidated Gaps, Solutions, and Dependencies matrix, including: 

<ul>
<li>Architecture domain</li>

<li>Gap</li>

<li>Potential solutions</li>

<li>Dependencies</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Any Transition Architectures</li>

<li>Implementation recommendations: 

<ul>
<li>Criteria measures of effectiveness of projects</li>

<li>Risks and issues</li>

<li>Solution Building Blocks (SBBs)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<br>
 

<h4><a name="tag_32_02_08"></a>32.2.8 Architecture Vision</h4>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_08_01"></a>Purpose</h5>

<p>The Architecture Vision is created early on in the ADM cycle. It provides a summary of the changes to the
enterprise that will accrue from successful deployment of the Target Architecture. The purpose of the Architecture Vision is to
provide key stakeholders with a formally agreed outcome. Early agreement on the outcome enables the architects to focus on the
detail necessary to validate feasibility. Providing an Architecture Vision also supports stakeholder communication by providing a
summary version of the full Architecture Definition.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_08_02"></a>Content</h5>

<p>Typical contents of an Architecture Vision are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Problem description: 

<ul>
<li>Stakeholders and their concerns</li>

<li>List of issues/scenarios to be addressed</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Objective of the Statement of Architecture Work</li>

<li>Summary views necessary for the Request for Architecture Work and the Version 0.1 Business, Application, Data, and
Technology Architectures created; typically including: 

<ul>
<li>Value Chain diagram</li>

<li>Solution Concept diagram</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Mapped requirements</li>

<li>Reference to Draft Architecture Definition Document</li>
</ul>

<br>
 

<h4><a name="tag_32_02_09"></a>32.2.9 Business Principles, Business Goals, and Business Drivers</h4>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_09_01"></a>Purpose</h5>

<p>Business principles, business goals, and business drivers provide context for architecture work, by describing the
needs and ways of working employed by the enterprise. Many factors that lie outside the consideration of architecture discipline
may nevertheless have significant implications for the way that architecture is developed.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_09_02"></a>Content</h5>

<p>The content and structure of business context for architecture is likely to vary considerably from one organization
to the next.<br>
</p>

<h4><a name="tag_32_02_10"></a>32.2.10 Capability Assessment</h4>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_10_01"></a>Purpose</h5>

<p>Before embarking upon a detailed Architecture Definition, it is valuable to understand the baseline and target
capability level of the enterprise. This Capability Assessment can be examined on several levels:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the capability level of the enterprise as a whole? Where does the enterprise wish to increase or optimize
capability? What are the architectural focus areas that will support the desired development of the enterprise?</li>

<li>What is the capability or maturity level of the IT function within the enterprise? What are the likely
implications of conducting the architecture project in terms of design governance, operational governance, skills, and organization
structure? What is an appropriate style, level of formality, and amount of detail for the architecture project to fit with the
culture and capability of the IT organization?</li>

<li>What is the capability and maturity of the architecture function within the enterprise? What architectural assets
are currently in existence? Are they maintained and accurate? What standards and reference models need to be considered? Are there
likely to be opportunities to create re-usable assets during the architecture project?</li>

<li>Where capability gaps exist, to what extent is the business ready to transform in order to reach the target
capability? What are the risks to transformation, cultural barriers, and other considerations to be addressed beyond the basic
capability gap?</li>
</ul>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_10_02"></a>Content</h5>

<p>Typical contents of a Capability Assessment are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Business Capability Assessment, including: 

<ul>
<li>Capabilities of the business</li>

<li>Baseline state assessment of the performance level of each capability</li>

<li>Future state aspiration for the performance level of each capability</li>

<li>Baseline state assessment of how each capability is realized</li>

<li>Future state aspiration for how each capability should be realized</li>

<li>Assessment of likely impacts to the business organization resulting from the successful deployment of the Target
Architecture</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>IT Capability Assessment, including: 

<ul>

<h4><a name="tag_32_02_11"></a>32.2.11 Change Request</h4>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_11_01"></a>Purpose</h5>

<p>During implementation of an architecture, as more facts become known, it is possible that the original Architecture
Definition and requirements are not suitable or are not sufficient to complete the implementation of a solution. In these
circumstances, it is necessary for implementation projects to either deviate from the suggested architectural approach or to
request scope extensions. Additionally, external factors - such as market factors, changes in business strategy, and new technology
opportunities - may open up opportunities to extend and refine the architecture.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, a Change Request may be submitted in order to kick-start a further cycle of architecture
work.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_11_02"></a>Content</h5>

<p>Typical contents of a Change Request are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Description of the proposed change</li>

<li>Rationale for the proposed change</li>

<li>Impact assessment of the proposed change, including: 

<ul>
<li>Reference to specific requirements</li>

<li>Stakeholder priority of the requirements to date</li>

<li>Phases to be revisited</li>

<li>Phase to lead on requirements prioritization</li>

<li>Results of phase investigations and revised priorities</li>

<li>Recommendations on management of requirements</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="tag_32_02_12"></a>32.2.12 Communications Plan</h4>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_12_01"></a>Purpose</h5>

<p>Enterprise Architectures contain large volumes of complex and inter-dependent information. Effective communication
of targeted information to the right stakeholders at the right time is a Critical Success Factor (CSF) for Enterprise Architecture.
Development of a Communications Plan for architecture allows for this communication to be carried out within a planned and managed
process.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_12_02"></a>Content</h5>

<p>Typical contents of a Communications Plan are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identification of stakeholders and grouping by communication requirements</li>

<li>Identification of communication needs, key messages in relation to the Architecture Vision, communication risks,
and CSFs</li>

<li>Identification of mechanisms that will be used to communicate with stakeholders and allow access to architecture
information, such as meetings, newsletters, repositories, etc.</li>

<li>Identification of a communications timetable, showing which communications will occur with which stakeholder
groups at what time and in what location</li>
</ul>

<br>
 

<h4><a name="tag_32_02_13"></a>32.2.13 Compliance Assessment</h4>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_13_01"></a>Purpose</h5>

<p>Once an architecture has been defined, it is necessary to govern that architecture through implementation to ensure
that the original Architecture Vision is appropriately realized and that any implementation learnings are fed back into the
architecture process. Periodic compliance reviews of implementation projects provide a mechanism to review project progress and
ensure that the design and implementation is proceeding in line with the strategic and architectural objectives.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_13_02"></a>Content</h5>

<p>Typical contents of a Compliance Assessment are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Overview of project progress and status</li>

<li>Overview of project architecture/design</li>

<li>Completed architecture checklists: 

<ul>
<li>Hardware and operating system checklist</li>

<li>Software services and middleware checklist</li>

<li>Applications checklists</li>

<li>Information management checklists</li>

<li>Security checklists</li>

<li>System management checklists<br>
</li>

<li>System engineering checklists</li>

<li>Methods and tools checklists</li>

<h4><a name="tag_32_02_14"></a>32.2.14 Implementation and Migration Plan</h4>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_14_01"></a>Purpose</h5>

<p>The Implementation and Migration Plan provides a schedule of the projects that will realize the Target
Architecture. The Implementation and Migration Plan includes executable projects grouped into managed portfolios and programs. The
Implementation and Migration Strategy identifying the approach to change is a key element of the Implementation and Migration
Plan.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_14_02"></a>Content</h5>

<p>Typical contents of an Implementation and Migration Plan are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Implementation and Migration Strategy: 

<ul>
<li>Strategic implementation direction</li>

<li>Implementation sequencing approach</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h4><a name="tag_32_02_15"></a>32.2.15 Implementation Governance Model</h4>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_15_01"></a>Purpose</h5>

<p>Once an architecture has been defined, it is necessary to plan how the Transition Architecture that implements the
architecture will be governed through implementation. Within organizations that have established architecture functions, there is
likely to be a governance framework already in place, but specific processes, organizations, roles, responsibilities, and measures
may need to be defined on a project-by-project basis.</p>

<p>The Implementation Governance Model ensures that a project transitioning into implementation also smoothly
transitions into appropriate Architecture Governance.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_15_02"></a>Content</h5>

<p>Typical contents of an Implementation Governance Model are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Governance processes</li>

<li>Governance organization structure</li>

<li>Governance roles and responsibilities</li>

<li>Governance checkpoints and success/failure criteria</li>
</ul>

<br>
 

<h4><a name="tag_32_02_16"></a>32.2.16 Organizational Model for Enterprise Architecture</h4>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_16_01"></a>Purpose</h5>

<p>In order for an architecture framework to be used successfully, it must be supported by the correct organization,
roles, and responsibilities within the enterprise. Of particular importance is the definition of boundaries between different
Enterprise Architecture practitioners and the governance relationships that span across these boundaries.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_16_02"></a>Content</h5>

<p>Typical contents of an Organizational Model for Enterprise Architecture are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scope of organizations impacted</li>

<li>Maturity assessment, gaps, and resolution approach</li>

<li>Roles and responsibilities for architecture team(s)</li>

<li>Constraints on architecture work</li>

<li>Budget requirements</li>

<li>Governance and support strategy</li>
</ul>

<br>
 

<h4><a name="tag_32_02_17"></a>32.2.17 Request for Architecture Work</h4>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_17_01"></a>Purpose</h5>

<p>This is a document that is sent from the sponsoring organization to the architecture organization to trigger the
start of an architecture development cycle. Requests for Architecture Work can be created as an output of the Preliminary Phase, a
result of approved architecture Change Requests, or terms of reference for architecture work originating from migration
planning.</p>

<p>In general, all the information in this document should be at a high level.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_17_02"></a>Content</h5>

<p>Requests for Architecture Work typically include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Organization sponsors</li>

<li>Organization's mission statement</li>

<li>Business goals (and changes)</li>

<li>Strategic plans of the business</li>

<li>Time limits</li>

<li>Changes in the business environment</li>

<li>Organizational constraints</li>

<li>Budget information, financial constraints</li>

<li>External constraints, business constraints</li>

<h4><a name="tag_32_02_18"></a>32.2.18 Requirements Impact Assessment</h4>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_18_01"></a>Purpose</h5>

<p>Throughout the ADM, new information is collected relating to an architecture. As this information is gathered, new
facts may come to light that invalidate existing aspects of the architecture. A Requirements Impact Assessment assesses the current
architecture requirements and specification to identify changes that should be made and the implications of those changes.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_18_02"></a>Content</h5>

<p>Typical contents of a Requirements Impact Assessment are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reference to specific requirements</li>

<li>Stakeholder priority of the requirements to date</li>

<li>Phases to be revisited</li>

<li>Phase to lead on requirements prioritization</li>

<li>Results of phase investigations and revised priorities</li>

<li>Recommendations on management of requirements</li>

<li>Repository reference number</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="tag_32_02_19"></a>32.2.19 Solution Building Blocks</h4>

<p>Implementation-specific building blocks from the enterprise's Architecture Repository; see <a href="pt4.html">Part
IV</a>, <a href="chap33.html#tag_33"><i>33. Building Blocks</i></a> .<br>
</p>

<h4><a name="tag_32_02_20"></a>32.2.20 Statement of Architecture Work</h4>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_20_01"></a>Purpose</h5>

<p>The Statement of Architecture Work defines the scope and approach that will be used to complete an architecture
development cycle. The Statement of Architecture Work is typically the document against which successful execution of the
architecture project will be measured and may form the basis for a contractual agreement between the supplier and consumer of
architecture services.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_20_02"></a>Content</h5>

<p>Typical contents of a Statement of Architecture Work are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Title</li>

<li>Architecture project request and background</li>

<li>Architecture project description and scope</li>

<li>Overview of Architecture Vision</li>

<li>Specific change of scope procedures</li>

<li>Roles, responsibilities, and deliverables</li>

<li>Acceptance criteria and procedures</li>

<li>Architecture project plan and schedule</li>

<li>Approvals</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="tag_32_02_21"></a>32.2.21 Tailored Architecture Framework</h4>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_21_01"></a>Purpose</h5>

<p>The TOGAF framework provides an industry standard for architecture that may be used in a wide variety of
organizations. However, before the TOGAF framework can be effectively used within an architecture project, tailoring at two levels
is necessary.</p>

<p>Firstly, it is necessary to tailor the TOGAF model for integration into the enterprise. This tailoring will include
integration with management frameworks, customization of terminology, development of presentational styles, selection,
configuration, and deployment of architecture tools, etc. The formality and detail of any frameworks adopted should also align with
other contextual factors for the enterprise, such as culture, stakeholders, commercial models for Enterprise Architecture, and the
existing level of Architecture Capability.</p>

<p>Once the framework has been tailored to the enterprise, further tailoring is necessary in order to tailor the
framework for the specific architecture project. Tailoring at this level will select appropriate deliverables and artifacts to meet
project and stakeholder needs.</p>

<p>See <a href="pt2.html">Part II</a>, <a href="chap05.html#tag_05_03_05"><i>5.3.5 Tailor the TOGAF Framework and, if
any, Other Selected Architecture Framework(s)</i></a> for further considerations when selecting and tailoring the architecture
framework.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_32_02_21_02"></a>Content</h5>

<p>Typical contents of a Tailored Architecture Framework are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tailored architecture method</li>

<li>Tailored architecture content (deliverables and artifacts)</li>

<li>Configured and deployed tools</li>

<li>Interfaces with governance models and other frameworks: 

<ul>
<li>Corporate Business Planning</li>

<li>Enterprise Architecture</li>

<li>Portfolio, Program, Project Management</li>

<li>System Development/Engineering</li>

<li>Operations (Services)</li>
</ul>
</li>
