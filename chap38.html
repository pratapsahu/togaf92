<h3><a name="tag_38_01"></a>38.1 Overview</h3>

<p>As an Enterprise Architecture framework, the TOGAF framework provides a basis for developing architectures in a uniform and
consistent manner. Its purpose in this respect is to ensure that the various Architecture Descriptions developed within an
enterprise, perhaps by different architects or architecture teams, support the comparison and integration of architectures within
and across architecture domains (business, data, application, technology), and relating to different business area scopes within
the enterprise.</p>

<p>To support this goal, the TOGAF standard defines numerous deliverables in the form of architectures, represented as architecture
models, architecture views of those models, and other artifacts. Over time, these artifacts become a resource that needs to be
managed and controlled, particularly with a view to re-use. This concept is referred to in the TOGAF standard as the "Enterprise
Continuum".</p>

<p>Architecture models and views are discussed in detail separately in <a href="pt4.html">Part IV</a>, <a href=
"chap31.html#tag_31"><i>31. Architectural Artifacts</i></a> . This section discusses considerations in choosing automated tools in
order to generate such architecture models and views, and to maintain them over time.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_38_02"></a>38.2 Issues in Tool Standardization</h3>

<p>In the current state of the tools market, many enterprises developing Enterprise Architectures struggle with the issue of
standardizing on tools, whether they seek a single "one size fits all" tool or a multi-tool suite for modeling architectures and
generating the different architecture views required.</p>

<p>There are ostensible advantages associated with selecting a single tool. Organizations following such a policy can hope to
realize benefits such as reduced training, shared licenses, quantity discounts, maintenance, and easier data interchange. However,
there are also reasons for refusing to identify a single mandated tool, including reasons of principle (endorsing a single
architecture tool would not encourage competitive commercial innovation or the development of advanced tool capability); and the
fact that a single tool would not accommodate a variety of architecture development "maturity levels" and specific needs across an
enterprise.</p>

<p>Successful Enterprise Architecture teams are often those that harmonize their architecture tools with their architecture
maturity level, team/organizational capabilities, and objectives or focus. If different organizations within an enterprise are at
different architecture maturity levels and have different objectives or focus (e.g., Enterprise <i>versus</i> Business
<i>versus</i> Technology Architecture), it becomes very difficult for one tool to satisfy all organizations' needs.
