<p>This chapter provides guidelines for ensuring project compliance to the architecture.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_42_01"></a>42.1 Introduction</h3>

<p>Ensuring the compliance of individual projects with the Enterprise Architecture is an essential aspect of Architecture
Governance (see <a href="chap44.html#tag_44"><i>44. Architecture Governance</i></a>). To this end, the IT governance function
within an enterprise will normally define two complementary processes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <b>Architecture</b> function will be required to prepare a series of Project Architectures; i.e., project-specific views of
the Enterprise Architecture that illustrate how the Enterprise Architecture impacts on the major projects within the organization
(see ADM Phases A to F)</li>

<li>The <b>IT Governance</b> function will define a formal Architecture Compliance review process (see <a href="#tag_42_03">42.3
Architecture Compliance Reviews</a>) for reviewing the compliance of projects to the Enterprise Architecture</li>
</ul>

<p>Apart from defining formal processes, the Architecture Governance function (see <a href="chap44.html#tag_44"><i>44. Architecture
Governance</i></a>) may also stipulate that the architecture function should extend beyond the role of architecture definition and
standards selection, and participate also in the technology selection process, and even in the commercial relationships involved in
external service provision and product purchases. This may help to minimize the opportunity for misinterpretation of the Enterprise
Architecture, and maximize the value of centralized commercial negotiation.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_42_02"></a>42.2 Terminology: The Meaning of Architecture Compliance</h3>

<p>A key relationship between the architecture and the implementation lies in the definitions of the terms "conformant",
"compliant", etc. While terminology usage may differ between organizations, the concepts of levels of conformance illustrated in <a
href="#tagfcjh_79">Figure 42-1</a> should prove useful in formulating an IT compliance strategy.</p>

<center><a href="Figures/48_conformance.png" target="new"><img src="Figures/48_conformance.png" border="0" width="50%">
</a></center>

<br>
<br>
 

<center><small><i><a name="tagfcjh_79"></a> Figure 42-1: Levels of Architecture Conformance</i></small></center>

<p>The phrase "in accordance with" in <a href="#tagfcjh_79">Figure 42-1</a> means:</p>

<ul>
<li>Supports the stated strategy and future directions</li>

<li>Adheres to the stated standards (including syntax and semantic rules specified)</li>

<li>Provides the stated functionality</li>

<li>Adheres to the stated principles; for example: 

<ul>
<li>Open wherever possible and appropriate</li>

<li>Re-use of component building blocks wherever possible and appropriate</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="tag_42_03"></a>42.3 Architecture Compliance Reviews</h3>

<p>An Architecture Compliance review is a scrutiny of the compliance of a specific project against established architectural
criteria, spirit, and business objectives. A formal process for such reviews normally forms the core of an Enterprise Architecture
Compliance strategy.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_42_03_01"></a>42.3.1 Purpose</h4>

<p>The goals of an Architecture Compliance review include some or all of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>First and foremost, catch errors in the project architecture early, and thereby reduce the cost and risk of changes required
later in the lifecycle 

<p>This in turn means that the overall project time is shortened, and that the business gets the bottom-line benefit of the
architecture development faster.</p>
</li>

<li>Ensure the application of best practices to architecture work</li>

<li>Provide an overview of the compliance of an architecture to mandated enterprise standards</li>

<li>Identify where the standards themselves may require modification</li>

<li>Identify services that are currently application-specific but might be provided as part of the enterprise infrastructure</li>

<li>Document strategies for collaboration, resource sharing, and other synergies across multiple architecture teams</li>

<li>Take advantage of advances in technology</li>

<li>Communicate to management the status of technical readiness of the project</li>

<li>Identify key criteria for procurement activities (e.g., for inclusion in Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) product RFI/RFP
documents)</li>

<li>Identify and communicate significant architectural gaps to product and service providers</li>
</ul>

<p>Apart from the generic goals related to quality assurance outlined above, there are additional, more politically-oriented
motivations for conducting Architecture Compliance reviews, which may be relevant in particular cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Architecture Compliance review can be a good way of deciding between architectural alternatives, since the business
decision-makers typically involved in the review can guide decisions in terms of what is best for the business, as opposed to what
is technically more pleasing or elegant</li>

<li>The output of the Architecture Compliance review is one of the few measurable deliverables to the CIO to assist in
decision-making</li>

<li>Architecture reviews can serve as a way for the architecture organization to engage with development projects that might
otherwise proceed without involvement of the architecture function</li>

<li>Architecture reviews can demonstrate rapid and positive support to the enterprise business community: 

<ul>
<li>The Enterprise Architecture and Architecture Compliance helps ensure the alignment of IT projects with business objectives</li>

<li>Architects can sometimes be regarded as being deep into technical infrastructure and far removed from the core business</li>

<li>Since an Architecture Compliance review tends to look primarily at the critical risk areas of a system, it often highlights the
main risks for system owners</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>While compliance to architecture is required for development and implementation, non-compliance also provides a mechanism for
highlighting:</p>

<ul>
<li>Areas to be addressed for realignment</li>

<li>Areas for consideration for integration into the architectures as they are uncovered by the compliance processes</li>
</ul>

<p>The latter point identifies the ongoing change and adaptability of the architectures to requirements that may be driven by
indiscipline, but also allows for changes to be registered by faster moving changes in the operational environment. Typically,
dispensations (see <a href="chap44.html#tag_44_01_04"><i>44.1.4 IT Governance</i></a>) will be used to highlight these changes and
set in motion a process for registering, monitoring, and assessing the suitability of any changes required.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_42_03_02"></a>42.3.2 Timing</h4>

<p>Timing of compliance activities should be considered with regard to the development of the architectures themselves.</p>

<p>Compliance reviews are held at appropriate project milestones or checkpoints in the project's lifecycle. Specific checkpoints
should be included as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Development of the architecture itself (ADM compliance)</li>

<li>Implementation of the architecture(s) (architecture compliance)</li>
</ul>

<p>Architecture project timings for assessments should include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Project initiation</li>

<li>Initial design</li>

<li>Major design changes</li>

<li><i>Ad hoc</i></li>
</ul>

<p>The Architecture Compliance review is typically targeted for a point in time when business requirements and the Enterprise
Architecture are reasonably firm, and the project architecture is taking shape, well before its completion.</p>

<p>The aim is to hold the review as soon as practical, at a stage when there is still time to correct any major errors or
shortcomings, with the obvious proviso that there needs to have been some significant development of the project architecture in
order for there to be something to review.</p>

<p>Inputs to the Architecture Compliance review may come from other parts of the standard project lifecycle, which may have an
impact on timing.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_42_03_03"></a>42.3.3 Governance and Personnel Scenarios</h4>

<p>In terms of the governance and conduct of the Architecture Compliance review, and the personnel involved, there are various
possible scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li>For smaller-scale projects, the review process could simply take the form of a series of questions that the project architects
or project leaders pose to themselves, using the checklists provided below, perhaps collating the answers into some form of project
report to management 

<p>The need to conduct such a process is normally included in overall enterprise-wide IT governance policies.</p>
</li>

<li>Where the project under review has not involved a practicing or full-time architect to date (for example, in an
application-level project), the purpose of the review is typically to bring to bear the architectural expertise of an Enterprise
Architecture function 

<p>In such a case, the Enterprise Architecture function would be organizing, leading, and conducting the review, with the
involvement of business domain experts. In such a scenario, the review is not a substitute for the involvement of architects in a
project, but it can be a supplement or a guide to their involvement. It is probable that a database will be necessary to manage the
volume of data that would be produced in the analysis of a large system or set of systems.</p>
</li>

<li>In most cases, particularly in larger-scale projects, the architecture function will have been deeply involved in, and perhaps
leading, the development project under review 

<p>(This is the typical TOGAF scenario.) In such cases, the review will be co-ordinated by the lead Enterprise Architect, who will
assemble a team of business and technical domain experts for the review, and compile the answers to the questions posed during the
review into some form of report. The questions will typically be posed during the review by the business and technical domain
experts. Alternatively, the review might be led by a representative of an Architecture Board or some similar body with
enterprise-wide responsibilities.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In all cases, the Architecture Compliance review process needs the backing of senior management, and will typically be mandated
as part of corporate Architecture Governance policies (see <a href="chap44.html#tag_44"><i>44. Architecture Governance</i></a>).
Normally, the enterprise CIO or Enterprise Architecture Board (see <a href="chap41.html#tag_41"><i>41. Architecture Board</i></a>)
will mandate architecture reviews for all major projects, with subsequent annual reviews.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_42_05"></a>42.5 Architecture Compliance Review Checklists</h3>

<p class="tent">The following review checklists provide a wide range of typical questions that may be used in conducting
Architecture Compliance reviews, relating to various aspects of the architecture. The organization of the questions includes the
basic disciplines of system engineering, information management, security, and systems management. The checklists are based on
material provided by a member of The Open Group, and are specific to that organization. Other organizations could use the following
checklists with other questions tailored to their own particular needs.</p>

<p class="tent">The checklists provided contain too many questions for any single review: they are intended to be tailored
selectively to the project concerned (see <a href="#tag_42_06">42.6 Architecture Compliance Review Guidelines</a>). The checklists
actually used will typically be developed/selected by subject matter experts. They are intended to be updated annually by interest
groups in those areas.</p>

<p class="tent">Some of the checklists include a brief description of the Architecture Principle that provokes the question, and a
brief description of what to look for in the answer. These extensions to the checklist are intended to allow the intelligent
re-phrasing of the questions, and to give the user of the checklist a feel for why the question is being asked.</p>

<p class="tent">Occasionally the questions will be written, as in RFPs, or in working with a senior project architect. More
typically they are expressed orally, as part of an interview or working session with the project.</p>

<p class="tent">The checklists provided here are designed for use in individual architecture projects, not for business domain
architecture or for architecture across multiple projects. (Doing an architecture review for a larger sphere of activity, across
multiple business processes and system projects, would involve a similar process, but the checklist categories and their contents
would be different.)</p>

<h3><a name="tag_42_06"></a>42.6 Architecture Compliance Review Guidelines</h3>

<h4><a name="tag_42_06_01"></a>42.6.1 Tailoring the Checklists</h4>

<ul>
<li class="tent">Focus on: 

<ul>
<li class="tent">High risk areas</li>

<li class="tent">Expected (and emergent) differentiators</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class="tent">For each question in the checklist, understand: 

<ul>
<li class="tent">The question itself</li>

<li class="tent">The principle behind it</li>

<li class="tent">What to look for in the responses</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class="tent">Ask subject experts for their views</li>

<li class="tent">Fix the checklist questions for your use</li>

<li class="tent">Bear in mind the need for feedback to the Architecture Board</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="tag_42_06_02"></a>42.6.2 Conducting Architecture Compliance Reviews</h4>

<ul>
<li class="tent">Understand clearly the objectives of those soliciting the review; and stay on track and deliver what was asked
for. For example, they typically want to know what is right or wrong with the system being architected; not what is right or wrong
with the development methodology used, their own management structure, etc. It is easy to get off-track and discuss subjects that
are interesting and perhaps worthwhile, but not what was solicited. If you can shed light and insight on technical approaches, but
the discussion is not necessary for the review, volunteer to provide it after the review.</li>

<li class="tent">If it becomes obvious during the discussion that there are other issues that need to be addressed, which are
outside the scope of the requested review, bring it up with the meeting chair afterwards. A plan for addressing the issues can then
be developed in accordance with their degree of seriousness.</li>

<li class="tent">Stay "scientific". Rather than: "We like to see large databases hosted on <i>ABC</i> rather than <i>XYZ</i>.", say
things like: "The downtime associated with <i>XYZ</i> database environments is much greater than on <i>ABC</i> database
environments. Therefore we don't recommend hosting type <i>M</i> and <i>N</i> systems in an <i>XYZ</i> environment."</li>

<li class="tent">Ask "open" questions; i.e., questions that do not presume a particular answer.</li>

<li class="tent">There are often "hidden agendas" or controversial issues among those soliciting a review, which you probably won't
know up-front. A depersonalized approach to the discussions may help bridge the gaps of opinion rather than exacerbate them.</li>

<li class="tent">Treat those being interviewed with respect. They may not have built the system "the way it should be", but they
probably did the best they could under the circumstances in which they were placed.</li>

<li class="tent">Help the exercise become a learning experience for you and the presenters.</li>

<li class="tent">Reviews should include detailed assessment activities against the architectures and should ensure that the results
are stored in the Enterprise Continuum.</li>
