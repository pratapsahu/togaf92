<p>This chapter provides techniques for evaluating and quantifying an organization's maturity in Enterprise Architecture.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_45_01"></a>45.1 Overview</h3>

<p>Organizations that can manage change effectively are generally more successful than those that cannot. Many organizations know
that they need to improve their processes in order to successfully manage change, but don't know how. Such organizations typically
either spend very little on process improvement, because they are unsure how best to proceed; or spend a lot, on a number of
parallel and unfocused efforts, to little or no avail.</p>

<p>Capability Maturity Models (CMMs) address this problem by providing an effective and proven method for an organization to
gradually gain control over and improve its change processes. Such models provide the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>They describe the practices that any organization must perform in order to improve its processes</li>

<li>They provide a yardstick against which to periodically measure improvement</li>

<li>They constitute a proven framework within which to manage the improvement efforts</li>

<li>They organize the various practices into levels, each level representing an increased ability to control and manage the
development environment</li>
</ul>

<p>An evaluation of the organization's practices against the model - called an "assessment" - determines the level at which the
organization currently stands. It indicates the organization's ability to execute in the area concerned, and the practices on which
the organization needs to focus in order to see the greatest improvement and the highest return on investment. The benefits of CMMs
to effectively direct effort are well documented.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_45_02"></a>45.2 Background</h3>

<p>The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu">www.sei.cmu.edu</a> operated by
Carnegie Mellon University - developed the original CMM (Capability Maturity Model) for Software (SWCMM) in the early 1990s, which
is still widely used today. This CMM provided a framework to develop maturity models in a wide range of disciplines.</p>

<p>The increasing interest in applying these techniques to other fields has resulted in a series of template tools which
assess:</p>

<ul>
<li>The state of the architecture processes</li>

<li>The architecture</li>

<li>The organization's buy-in to both</li>
</ul>

<p>The main issues addressed by these models include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Process implementation and audit</li>

<li>Quality measurements</li>

<li>People competencies</li>

<li>Investment management</li>
</ul>

<p>They involve use of a multiplicity of models, and focus in particular on measuring business benefits and return on
investment.</p>

<p>A closely related topic is the Architecture Skills Framework (see <a href="chap46.html#tag_46"><i>46. Architecture Skills
Framework</i></a>), which can be used to plan the target skills and capabilities required by an organization to successfully
develop and utilize Enterprise Architecture, and to determine the training and development needs of individuals.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_45_03"></a>45.3 US DoC ACMM Framework</h3>

<h4><a name="tag_45_03_01"></a>45.3.1 Overview</h4>

<p>As an example of the trend towards increased interest in applying CMM techniques to Enterprise Architecture, all US Federal
agencies are now expected to provide maturity models and ratings as part of their IT investment management and audit
requirements.</p>

<p>In particular, the US Department of Commerce (DoC) has developed an Architecture Capability Maturity Model (ACMM)
to aid in conducting internal assessments. The ACMM provides a framework that
represents the key components of a productive Enterprise Architecture process. The goal is to enhance the overall odds for success
of Enterprise Architecture by identifying weak areas and providing a defined evolutionary path to improving the overall
architecture process.<br>
</p>

<p>The ACMM comprises three sections:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Enterprise Architecture maturity model</li>

<li>Enterprise Architecture characteristics of operating units' processes at different maturity levels</li>

<li>The Enterprise Architecture CMM scorecard</li>
</ol>

<p>The first two sections explain the Architecture Capability maturity levels and the corresponding Enterprise Architecture element
and characteristics for each maturity level to be used as measures in the assessment process. The third section is used to derive
the Architecture Capability maturity level that is to be reported to the DoC Chief Information Officer (CIO).</p>

<h4><a name="tag_45_03_02"></a>45.3.2 Elements of the ACMM</h4>

<p>The DoC ACMM consists of six maturity levels and nine architecture elements. The six levels are:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt>0</dt>

<dd>None</dd>

<dt>1</dt>

<dd>Initial</dd>

<dt>2</dt>

<dd>Under development</dd>

<dt>3</dt>

<dd>Defined</dd>

<dt>4</dt>

<dd>Managed</dd>

<dt>5</dt>

<dd>Measured</dd>
</dl>

<p>The nine Enterprise Architecture elements are:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt>1</dt>

<dd>Architecture process</dd>

<dt>2</dt>

<dd>Architecture development</dd>

<dt>3</dt>

<dd>Business linkage</dd>

<dt>4</dt>

<dd>Senior management involvement</dd>

<dt>5</dt>

<dd>Operating unit participation</dd>

<dt>6</dt>

<dd>Architecture communication</dd>

<dt>7</dt>

<dd>IT security</dd>

<dt>8</dt>

<dd>Architecture Governance</dd>

<dt>9</dt>

<dd>IT investment and acquisition strategy</dd>
</dl>

<p>Two complementary methods are used in the ACMM to calculate a maturity rating. The first method obtains a weighted mean
Enterprise Architecture maturity level. The second method shows the percentage achieved at each maturity level for the nine
architecture elements.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_45_03_03"></a>45.3.3 Example: Enterprise Architecture Process Maturity Levels</h4>

<p>The following example shows the detailed characteristics of the Enterprise Architecture maturity levels as applied to each of
the nine elements. For example, Level 3: Defined, point number 8 (Explicit documented governance of majority of IT investments)
shows Maturity Level 3's state for Element 8 (Architecture Governance).</p>

<h3><a name="tag_45_04"></a>45.4 Capability Maturity Models Integration (CMMI)</h3>

<h4><a name="tag_45_04_01"></a>45.4.1 Introduction</h4>

<p>The capability models that the SEI is currently involved in developing, expanding, or maintaining include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration)</li>

<li>IPD-CMM&reg; (Integrated Product Development Capability Maturity Model)</li>

<li>P-CMM&reg; (People Capability Maturity Model)</li>

<li>SA-CMM&reg; (Software Acquisition Capability Maturity Model)</li>

<li>SE-CMM&reg; (Systems Engineering Capability Maturity Model)</li>

<li>SW-CMM&reg; (Capability Maturity Model for Software)</li>
</ul>

<p>As explained in this chapter, in recent years the industry has witnessed significant growth in the area of maturity models. The
multiplicity of models available has led to problems of its own, in terms of how to integrate all the different models to produce a
meaningful metric for overall process maturity.</p>

<p>In response to this need, the SEI has developed a Framework called Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), to provide a
means of managing the complexity.</p>

<p>According to the SEI, the use of the CMMI models improves on the best practices of previous models in many important ways, in
particular enabling organizations to:</p>

<ul>
<li>More explicitly link management and engineering activities to business objectives</li>

<li>Expand the scope of and visibility into the product lifecycle and engineering activities to ensure that the product or service
meets customer expectations</li>

<li>Incorporate lessons learned from additional areas of best practice (e.g., measurement, risk management, and supplier
management)</li>

<li>Implement more robust high-maturity practices</li>

<li>Address additional organizational functions critical to its products and services</li>

<li>More fully comply with relevant ISO standards</li>
</ul>

<p>CMMI is being adopted worldwide.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_45_04_02"></a>45.4.2 SCAMPI Method</h4>

<p>The Standard CMMI Appraisal Method for Process Improvement (SCAMPI&reg;) is the appraisal method associated with CMMI. The
SCAMPI appraisal method is used to identify strengths, weaknesses, and ratings relative to CMMI reference models. It incorporates
best practices found successful in the appraisal community, and is based on the features of several legacy appraisal methods. It is
applicable to a wide range of appraisal usage modes, including both internal process improvement and external capability
determinations.</p>

<p>The SCAMPI method definition document describes the requirements,
activities, and practices associated with each of the processes that compose the SCAMPI method.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_45_05"></a>45.5 Conclusions</h3>

<p>This section has sought to introduce into the TOGAF standard the topic of CMM-based methods and techniques for use in relation
to Enterprise Architecture.</p>

<p>The benefits of using CMMs are well documented. Future versions of the TOGAF standard may include a maturity model to measure
adoption of the TOGAF standard itself.</p>
